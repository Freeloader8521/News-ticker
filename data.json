      "summary_orig": "United States Senator Lindsey Graham called on Sunday for renewed military action against Hamas and Hezbollah if they fail to disarm and accused the Palestinian group of consolidating its power in Gaza. The Republican politician, on a visit to Israel, is a staunch ally of US President Donald Trump. Beginning in October, a fragile ceasefire has so far halted two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip despite both sides trading accusations of truce violations. A separate ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah also came into effect in November 2024 after more than a year of hostilities, though Israel continues to carry out strikes on Lebanese territory. Israel has made dismantling the arsenals of both groups, allies of its arch-foe Iran, a key condition for any lasting peace. “It’s imperative we come up with a plan quickly, put Hamas on a time clock, give them a period of time to achieve the goal of disarmament,” Graham said at a press conference during his visit. “And if you don’t, I would encourage President Trump to unleash Israel to go finish off Hamas. “It’s a long, brutal war, but you cannot be successful anywhere in the region until you deliver on dealing Hamas out of the future of Gaza and disarming them,” Graham added, insisting that the second stage of the truce would fail if Hamas remains armed. “Ninety days after the ceasefire, they are consolidating power in Gaza.“ Graham also called for military engagement against Hezbollah if it too does not surrender its weapons. “If Hezbollah refuses to give up their heavy weapons, down the road we should engage in military operations working with Lebanon, Israel and the United States, where we fly with Israel … to take Hezbollah out,” Graham said. Opposition to Turkiye The Lebanese government has begun to disarm Hezbollah, starting in the country’s south, and insists it will complete the plan. Israel, however, has questioned the effectiveness of the Lebanese military, while Hezbollah itself has repeatedly refused to lay down its weapons. Graham’s remarks came a day after mediators the US, Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye urged both sides in the war on Gaza to uphold the ceasefire. The mediators are pressing for the implementation of the second phase of the truce, which would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of an international stabilisation force and the establishment of an interim authority to govern the territory in place of Hamas. The second phase of the Gaza truce also envisages the demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas. Graham backed Israel’s opposition to Turkiye being included in the stabilisation force , saying it would “rock Israel to its core”. “There is no political support anywhere in Israel for having Turkiye being involved in the stabilising force,” he said. Hamas, meanwhile, has called on the mediators and Washington to stop Israeli violations of the ceasefire in Gaza. On Sunday, Israeli artillery shelling was reported in several parts of Gaza’s southern area of Khan Yunis, according to the civil defence agency, which operates under the authority of Hamas. On Friday, six people, including two children, were killed in an Israeli bombing of a school serving as a shelter for displaced people, according to the agency.",

The date coincides with the second anniversary of the 2024 general elections , in which the current PML-N government rose to power. Claiming that the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before, the TTAP also decided to form a committee headed by Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, with Haleem Adil Sheikh, Zain Shah and others to constitute committees at the provincial and district level. The TTAP announced that it will also organise conferences at all provincial headquarters and engage bar councils, civil society and the public for efforts for the restoration of the Constitution, rule of law and democracy in Pakistan. Those who attended today’s conference included TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, PTI leaders Asad Qaiser and Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Akhtar Mengal and others. CM Afridi, who also attended the conference, told media persons that, as per the directions of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, the preparations for the countrywide movement have been started. “We will meet every person and will tell them to wait for the second call. We will go to Rawalpindi, Lahore, KP and other parts of the country,” he said while replying to questions. According to the declaration from the conference, as democracy was not possible without free and fair elections, an effort would be made to ensure free and fair elections. Participants demanded the immediate appointment of a neutral chief election commissioner and next elections be held under a reconstituted Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). They also demanded an independent investigation into the February 8 elections and to identify and punish “responsible personalities”. Participants were of the view that the judiciary was dismantled through the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments and alleged that conscientious judges , including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza , were forced to leave the institution, with arrangements made to sideline the remaining judges. They further alleged that most recently, action was taken against Islamabad High Court Judge Justice Tariq Jahangiri , who was removed from his office over a fake degree. The conference claimed that these officials demanded to restore the judiciary in accordance with the original 1973 Constitution. The conference also condemned the convictions against the PTI founder and his wife and the “inhumane treatment” of Imran’s sisters, including “their being attacked by water cannons.” Additionally, the participants demanded the release of prisoners, including Imran, his wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Sarfraz Cheema, among others. TTAP also condemned the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), alleging that it was passed to curtail media freedom, additionally showing concerns over the economic strangulation of Dawn Media Group. Moreover, the participants expressed complete solidarity with journalists who “lost their jobs under the system” and denounced the narcotics case against journalist Matiullah Jan. The cases registered against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were also condemned. The opposition was also of the view that statements and reports regarding the deployment of Pakistan’s armed forces in Gaza reflected “alarming non-transparency”. They demanded that the nation be taken into confidence before any decision was made. The conference additionally cited the World Bank, claiming that over 44 per cent of Pakistan’s population lived below the poverty line, while the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) reports indicated corruption amounting to Rs 5,300 billion. They assailed the government for failing to curb unemployment, inflation, and poverty and lacked a roadmap for relief. The TTAP also expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh and Balochistan and demanded the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch detainees. The opposition alliance demanded the implementation of unanimous resolutions passed by the KP Assembly Jirga and the release of outstanding federal dues to the province. It also called for lifting the ban on the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement. They said under the 18th Amendment, minerals belonged to the provinces and that entering into international mining agreements without taking provincial governments and local populations into confidence violated it. The TTAP also demanded the immediate restoration of student unions across the country. In view of the ongoing national crisis, the conference unanimously agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed nine terrorists as a result of two separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 19 December 2025, nine khwarij belonging to Indian proxy fitna al khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It added that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists in the Dera Ismail Khan district of the province. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij ’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, four khwarij were sent to hell.” Per the statement, the second IBO was conducted in the Bannu district. “In ensuing fire exchange, five more khwarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces.” The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists, who had remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies, and the target killing of innocent civilians. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years. Last week, security forces had killed 13 terrorists in two operations in Mohmand and Bannu districts of the province.",

      "title_orig": "Law minister Tarar stresses need for ‘national dialogue’, highlights significance of political and economic stability",
      "summary_orig": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar stressed on Sunday the need for a national dialogue, saying Pakistan required political and economic stability as the country remains mired in political clashes between the government and the opposition. “Politics is the name of a continuous process,“ he said, as he addressed a seminar in Lahore. “No country or nation can progress amid political and economic instability.” The relationship between the government and the opposition has come under additional strain in recent weeks, especially after the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan as a “national security threat”, triggering a strong reaction . Moreover, Imran, who is already facing a slew of legal cases, was once again sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday, making his release uncertain. The law minister stated that the country had witnessed cultures of tolerance as well as violence, emphasising that it was the duty of politicians to “balance out” these tendencies and pave a way through “dialogue”. He emphasised that all politicians must play their role in preventing violence and extremism from paving the way into politics. “We feel the need for a national dialogue, only for the sake of our beloved country.“ Emphasising restraint and respect for dissent, he called for “listening to opponents, embracing positive criticism, and forging a national political charter to ensure stability”. Meanwhile, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) – the grand opposition alliance headed by Mahmood Khan Achakzai – is currently holding a two-day national conference in Islamabad. The alliance had also called for a national dialogue in all parties’ conference in August, calling for a new charter of democracy between all political stakeholders. “The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” they said. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had also shown his willingness to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. However, there has been no formal initiation of the dialogue between the government and the opposition since last year. PM’s advisor warns against ‘confrontation and violence’ Speaking at the same event, the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said political stability can only be achieved through “restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.” He warned that “confrontation and violence” had repeatedly derailed Pakistan’s democratic course. “No nation can progress through fighting, chaos and disorder,” adding that attacks on defence installations were “gravely wrong” and unacceptable. He argued that political instability emerges when parties abandon dialogue for confrontation, stressing that the government has repeatedly offered talks. “Tell us — who is refusing dialogue? If it is us, we will correct ourselves; if it is someone else, name them,” he said. Rejecting claims that the general elections were selectively fair or unfair, Sanaullah recalled that even in 2018, the opposition alleged mandate theft, yet extended an offer to work together in parliament — an offer that was rebuffed with threats of imprisonment by Imran. “If elections are disputed, political parties — not the establishment — must decide the way forward. Political stability is essential for national progress.” Sanaullah also cited overtures made before the passage of this year’s budget, saying Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly invited the opposition for talks, including in the presence of the military leadership, proposing a ‘Charter of Pakistan’. “Who is declining political dialogue?” he asked again, urging clarity to remove ambiguities blocking stability. The former interior minister said, noting that while second-tier leadership within the PTI favours dialogue, fear of backlash from within the party’s ranks had stifled it. Saad Rafique calls for Charters of Democracy and Economy Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique called for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, warning against inter-provincial polarisation and repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote. Rafique underscored that confrontation and chaos cannot strengthen the state, warning that repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote had eroded public trust. Calling for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, he urged “engagement with all constitutional forces and dialogue with institutions to reduce political pressure and restore stability”.",

Rejecting claims that the general elections were selectively fair or unfair, Sanaullah recalled that even in 2018, the opposition alleged mandate theft, yet extended an offer to work together in parliament — an offer that was rebuffed with threats of imprisonment by Imran. “If elections are disputed, political parties — not the establishment — must decide the way forward. Political stability is essential for national progress.” Sanaullah also cited overtures made before the passage of this year’s budget, saying Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly invited the opposition for talks, including in the presence of the military leadership, proposing a ‘Charter of Pakistan’. “Who is declining political dialogue?” he asked again, urging clarity to remove ambiguities blocking stability. The former interior minister said, noting that while second-tier leadership within the PTI favours dialogue, fear of backlash from within the party’s ranks had stifled it. Saad Rafique calls for Charters of Democracy and Economy Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique called for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, warning against inter-provincial polarisation and repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote. Rafique underscored that confrontation and chaos cannot strengthen the state, warning that repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote had eroded public trust. Calling for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, he urged “engagement with all constitutional forces and dialogue with institutions to reduce political pressure and restore stability”.",

      "summary": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar stressed on Sunday the need for a national dialogue, saying Pakistan required political and economic stability as the country remains mired in political clashes between the government and the opposition. “Politics is the name of a continuous process,“ he said, as he addressed a seminar in Lahore. “No country or nation can progress amid political and economic instability.” The relationship between the government and the opposition has come under additional strain in recent weeks, especially after the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan as a “national security threat”, triggering a strong reaction . Moreover, Imran, who is already facing a slew of legal cases, was once again sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday, making his release uncertain. The law minister stated that the country had witnessed cultures of tolerance as well as violence, emphasising that it was the duty of politicians to “balance out” these tendencies and pave a way through “dialogue”. He emphasised that all politicians must play their role in preventing violence and extremism from paving the way into politics. “We feel the need for a national dialogue, only for the sake of our beloved country.“ Emphasising restraint and respect for dissent, he called for “listening to opponents, embracing positive criticism, and forging a national political charter to ensure stability”. Meanwhile, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) – the grand opposition alliance headed by Mahmood Khan Achakzai – is currently holding a two-day national conference in Islamabad. The alliance had also called for a national dialogue in all parties’ conference in August, calling for a new charter of democracy between all political stakeholders. “The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” they said. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had also shown his willingness to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. However, there has been no formal initiation of the dialogue between the government and the opposition since last year. PM’s advisor warns against ‘confrontation and violence’ Speaking at the same event, the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said political stability can only be achieved through “restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.” He warned that “confrontation and violence” had repeatedly derailed Pakistan’s democratic course. “No nation can progress through fighting, chaos and disorder,” adding that attacks on defence installations were “gravely wrong” and unacceptable. He argued that political instability emerges when parties abandon dialogue for confrontation, stressing that the government has repeatedly offered talks. “Tell us — who is refusing dialogue? If it is us, we will correct ourselves; if it is someone else, name them,” he said. Rejecting claims that the general elections were selectively fair or unfair, Sanaullah recalled that even in 2018, the opposition alleged mandate theft, yet extended an offer to work together in parliament — an offer that was rebuffed with threats of imprisonment by Imran. “If elections are disputed, political parties — not the establishment — must decide the way forward.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan produced a dominant all-round performance to thrash arch-rivals India by a massive 191 runs in the final of the U-19 Asia Cup at the ICC Academy Ground on Sunday, claiming the prestigious title in emphatic fashion. Opener Sameer Minhas lit up the first half of the match with a record-breaking 172 — the highest individual score in a U-19 Asia Cup final — propelling Pakistan to a formidable 347 for 8 after being asked to bat first. In reply, India’s much-vaunted batting line-up crumbled spectacularly, folding for a paltry 156 in just 26.2 overs as pacer Ali Raza ripped through the order with figures of 4 for 42. The victory marked a sweet redemption for Pakistan, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the same opponents in the group stage and had entered the final as underdogs against an unbeaten Indian side. Instead, it was Pakistan who delivered a clinical display, overwhelming India in every department to lift the trophy amid jubilant celebrations. India captain Ayush Mhatre won the toss and elected to bowl, perhaps hoping to restrict Pakistan on a surface expected to assist the seamers early on. However, the decision backfired spectacularly as Sameer launched a brutal assault from the outset. After Hamza Zahoor fell early for 18, Sameer combined with Usman Khan (35) and Ahmed Hussain (56) in substantial partnerships — 92 for the second wicket and 137 for the third — to put Pakistan in complete command. The right-hander brought up his century off 71 balls and raced to 172 off 113 deliveries, studded with 17 fours and nine sixes, before falling to a slower ball from Deepesh Devendran in the 43rd over. A late flurry of wickets — five falling for 45 runs in the final overs — prevented Pakistan from reaching 400, but their total remained the highest ever posted in a U-19 Asia Cup final. Khilan Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 2 for 44, while Devendran claimed 3 for 83. Chasing 348, India started explosively, racing to 21 in the first over off Ali Raza, with Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashing a six and four in an over that also included a no-ball and extras. Suryavanshi continued the onslaught, striking three sixes and a four in his blistering 26 off 10 balls. But the introduction of spin and disciplined pace turned the tide irreversibly. Captain Mhatre (2) holed out to mid-off, Aaron George (16 off 9) miscued a pull, and Suryavanshi nicked behind — all falling to Raza and Mohammad Sayyam as India slipped to 49 for 3 in the fifth over. The collapse deepened. Vihaan Malhotra (7) was bowled attempting a rash pull off Abdul Subhan, Vedant Trivedi (9) found short midwicket, and Abhigyan Kundu (13) upper-cut to deep third. Kanishk Chouhan (9) and Khilan Patel (19) offered brief resistance, but regular strikes kept India on the back foot. Lower down, Deepesh Devendran provided late entertainment with a quickfire 36 off 16 balls, including six fours and two sixes, but his dismissal — skying one to point off Raza — ended any lingering hopes. Subhan (2-29) and off-spinner Huzaifa Ahsan (2-12) chipped in effectively, while Sayyam supported with 2 for 38. India’s innings lasted a mere 26.2 overs, underscoring Pakistan’s bowling dominance and fielding sharpness after the break. The margin of victory was the largest in a U-19 Asia Cup final, completing a comprehensive rout. Man of the Match Sameer was hoisted onto his team-mates’ shoulders as Pakistan celebrated wildly, while India, unbeaten until the final, were left to rue a day when nothing went right.",

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir has said that formations of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban (TTP) infiltrating into Pakistan mostly comprised Afghans. “In the TTP formations coming [into Pakistan], 70 per cent are Afghans,” he said. The defence forces’ chief made this statement at the National Ulema Conference held in Islamabad on December 10. However, details of the Field Marshal’s address at the conference were scant thus far and clips of his speech from the event were broadcast on television today. Islamabad has repeatedly urged Kabul to put an end to the use of Afghan soil by terrorists for carrying out attacks in Pakistan. Kabul, however, denies the allegation. Turning his attention to the matter at the conference, CDF Munir questioned: “Is Afghanistan not spilling the blood of our Pakistani children?” He recalled that the Afghan Taliban had been told to choose between Pakistan and the TTP. Speaking about the four-day May conflict with India, he said in Pakistan’s retaliatory operation during the confrontation, Bunyanum Marsoos, the armed forces received “divine help”. “We felt it,” he commented. India launched a series of strikes in the early hours of May 7 across Pakistan, an act which led to the worst between the old foes in decades. Both sides used fighter jets, missiles , artillery and drones during the four-day conflict, killing dozens of people , before agreeing to a ceasefire . The confrontation followed an attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam on April 22, which resulted in the death of 26 people. While New Delhi blamed Islamabad for the attack without evidence, Pakistan denied involvement, with the foreign ministry questioning the credibility of India’s account of the events and saying it was “replete with fabrications”. The Field Marshal also stated that there were 57 Islamic countries in the world, and among them, “God gave us the honour of being the protectors of Haramain Sharifain (a reference to Makkah and Madina)”. He also drew parallels between Pakistan and the Islamic State established in Saudi Arabia 1,400 years ago. “Both are founded for the same reason […], were founded in the same month, the Ramazan, and their establishment involved the element of migration.” The CDF further said that no one could order jihad in an Islamic state other than the state itself. “No one can issue a fatwa for jihad without the order and permission and will of those vested with the authority,” he said during the conference. The Field Marshal also cited multiple verses from the Quran during his address.",

      "summary_orig": "As fog engulfed several areas of Karachi on Sunday morning and the city experienced “very unhealthy” weather conditions, flight disruptions and one road accident death were reported. Low visibility due to fog was reported from Super Highway, Surjani Town, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, I.I. Chundrigarh Road, Clifton and Defence. Updates on the Karachi airport’s website showed that multiple flights were cancelled or delayed in the morning. Pakistan Airports Authority spokesperson Saifullah Khan confirmed in a statement that six international flights scheduled to land in Karachi had to be diverted due to fog. The statement said that the diversion was a usual safety measure taken due to reduced visibility. It added that Pegasus Airlines, Eitehad Airways, Flyadeal and Gulf Air flights had been diverted to Muscat. Moreover, a Pakistan International Airlines flight that had departed from Madina, too, had to be divered to Muscat. Similarly, Fly Jinnah flight arriving from Jeddah was diverted to Islamabad. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), shallow fog also engulfed the Rahim Yar Khan-Karachi Highway and Karachi-Lasbella Highway between 8am and 11am. Air quality Updates on air quality monitoring platform IQAir around 11:30am showed that the air quality was “very unhealthy” in the city, with an AQI reading of 282. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is a measure of the concentration of various pollutants in the air, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), coarse particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone (O3). Any IQAir AQI ranking above 150 is considered “unhealthy” and above 200 is considered “very unhealthy”. Road accident Police, meanwhile, reported the death of a motorcyclist in an accident, attributing it to hazy weather conditions, among other factors. South Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Asad Raza told Dawn that the incident occurred on Clifton Bridge due to “smog, slippery roads and speeding”. As his motorcycle slipped, he died on the spot, the DIG said, adding that his body was first taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre and later handed over to his heirs.",

      "summary_orig": "Illustration by Abro George Orwell’s classic novel Nineteen Eighty-Four , published in 1949, explores a fictional totalitarian regime that maintains absolute power by dismantling individual thought, memory and personal connection. Orwell wrote the novel after witnessing the rise of fascism in Germany and, especially, the Stalinist system in the Soviet Union. A self-described socialist, Orwell fought against fascists in the Spanish Civil War (1936-39). But he critically differentiated between ‘democratic-socialism’ and the communism practised in the Soviet Union. By the time Nineteen Eighty-Four was published, totalitarianism in Germany had fallen, but Stalinism persisted. Orwell was particularly disturbed by the Soviet Union’s trajectory, having already satirised it in his 1945 allegory Animal Farm . In Nineteen Eighty-Four , he presented a warning about communism’s potential to create a terrifying dystopia. The term ‘Orwellian’ quickly entered political discourse as a universal descriptor for state overreach, the manipulation of truth and society’s tendency toward mass surveillance and the erosion of individual privacy. From e-challans to clamping down on fake news, almost everything is lazily labelled as ‘Orwellian’ these days by people who do not understand exactly what George Orwell’s writing was critiquing However, since the conclusion of the Cold War in 1991, one can argue that the term ‘Orwellian’ has been stripped of its original meaning, often serving as a catch-all phrase for any unpopular policy. Recently, a friend described the e-challan traffic cameras installed in Karachi as “Orwellian”. He was serious. In a 2021 essay, American novelist Rachel Klein observed that Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ have become political shorthand for censorship and authoritarianism, often used by those who wish to decry state power but without truly understanding Orwell’s specific critiques. Individuals frequently cite the novel and the term due to personal grievances, such as facing social media bans, increased taxation or ‘unpopular’ judicial decisions, regardless of the novel’s actual context. This linguistic drift mirrors the devaluation of the word ‘fascism’. Orwell himself noted in 1944 that the word ‘fascism’ had lost its weight, becoming a mere synonym for the word ‘bully’. Historically, fascism was a systematic, amoral ideology that sparked genocides and a global war while attempting the total psychological subjugation of society. As a word, it just cannot be used nonchalantly or in a matter-of-fact manner. The term ‘Orwellian’ has also become trivialised. Many scholars posit that the manner in which the term is applied to modern inconveniences qualifies it to become obsolete. To understand why this is so, one must look at how modern society differs from the one in Orwell’s novel. The nature of social control in reality is dramatically different from the dystopian world envisioned in Orwell’s Nineteen Eighty-Four . American-Canadian cultural theorist Henry A. Giroux observes that while, in the novel, the state enforced surveillance through omnipresent/unavoidable telescreens, today, surveillance is largely voluntary. People willingly exchange their biometrics, habits and movements via the convenience of smartphones, social media and smart home devices. Furthermore, according to Indian assistant professor Anuradha, instead of the monolithic state serving as the primary overseer in Orwell’s narrative, in today’s reality, the main overseers in this regard are private corporate entities. This paradigm is often termed “surveillance capitalism”, where corporations harvest massive amounts of personal data, converting the human experience into data and selling it for profit, making the corporate entity, rather than the state, the primary overseer of the 21st century. This has actually weakened the role of the state. In fact, the state is also struggling to come to terms with this reality. In Nineteen Eighty-Four , the state physically deleted or rewrote history, but modern day control is often achieved through information saturation and/or through an overwhelming abundance of content, misinformation and algorithmic echo chambers that intentionally obscure the distinction between truth and fiction. These are often the doings of new tech corporations and citizens, and not so much of the state. In other words, these conditions are largely being produced by non-state actors. In another stark contrast, Nineteen Eighty-Four depicted a world defined by constant war and extreme scarcity, enforced rationing and austerity. Many modern societies, however, are driven by hectic consumption, fuelled by advertising and rapacity. Adding to this conceptual dilution is the trivialised way Orwell’s novel and the term ‘Orwellian’ are currently used by the political left and right. They accuse each other of being ‘Orwellian’, much like they use the term ‘fascist’/‘fascism’. Both sides have drained these words of their actual meaning, using them instead as clichés for anything they disagree with. Both have hollowed out the actual meaning of these terms, employing them as facile labels for disagreement. A lot of people, both on the right and the left, frequently apply the term ‘Orwellian’ when private companies such as X and Facebook ban accounts. Yet, ‘Orwellian’ strictly describes state-sponsored control of thought and language. Nothing’s private in his novel. The term is also misapplied to government policies such as pandemic lockdowns or public health mandates, despite Orwell’s support for state intervention during crises. The pushback against clamping down on fake news is also termed as ‘Orwellian’ by many ‘free speech’ advocates. The irony is that it is the pushback that is actually ‘Orwellian’, because the creation of an alternative reality through fake news and claims using political jargon is arguably the very essence of the distortion that Orwell warned against. Orwell’s true target was totalitarianism in all its forms, encompassing both the right and the left. In 2021, the American writer Benjamin Newcomb wrote that the term ‘Orwellian’ has become too vague, too cliché and too pretentious to be of use anymore. It is invoked to describe any number of events that its user finds distasteful. The issue is not that ‘Orwellian’ is an ill-conceived word, but that it is a word whose meaning has frayed. Sales of Nineteen Eighty-Four have once again spiked in recent years. Indeed, Orwell is back in vogue, but still quite out of context. Published in Dawn, EOS, December 21st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "PESHAWAR: The Peshawar High Court has declared that the protective bails, granted to scores of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s lawmakers and leaders, including Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, were meant to facilitate their appearance before the relevant courts, so the relief shouldn’t be used for participating in protests or anti-state activities. “This interim relief shall not, under any circumstances, be construed, interpreted, invoked or relied upon by the petitioner(s) as a shield, protection, justification, or safeguard for any purpose other than facilitating their appearance before the competent court. For abundant caution, it is further clarified that this order shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to enable, justify or facilitate the petitioner(s) participation in any protest, demonstration, anti-state activity, or any event of a similar nature,” reads a ruling by a bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali in multiple cases. It declared that any misuse, abuse or attempt to extend the scope of that order beyond the limited purpose for which it had been granted would expose the petitioner(s) to appropriate legal consequences, including, but not limited to, proceedings in accordance with the law. The court issued these directives in a four-page detailed decision on the petition of former National Assembly speaker and current MNA Asad Qaiser and other PTI leaders. Bench declares that relief granted only for approaching relevant courts Qaiser had sought details of the cases registered against him by law-enforcement agencies and the grant of protective bail in those cases. The other petitions were filed by MPAs Sohail Afridi and former chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, MNAs Sheikh Waqas Akram, Naseem Shah, Faisal Amin Khan, Shandana Gulzar, Noorul Haq Qadri and Yousaf Ali, Senator Khurram Zeeshan and several other PTI leaders. On the plea of Islamabad’s chief commissioner, the bench had referred all these connected petitions to the chief justice on Dec 9for constituting a larger bench for hearing. The bench ruled that since certain crucial issues, as identified by the federal prosecutor general as well as other counsel, were involved in this matter, the office was directed to place the matter before the chief justice of this court for the formation of a larger bench. In the detailed order, the bench directed the Islamabad chief commissioner to act as focal person between the petitioners and the law-enforcement agencies at federal level as well as within Islamabad. It declared: “The petitioner(s) in the present case, as well as in the connected cases, shall approach the said office through an application, either directly or through an advocate, seeking information regarding their involvement in criminal cases within three days of the receipt of this order.” “Upon receipt of such application, the worthy Chief Commissioner, Islamabad, shall procure the record of all criminal cases in which the arrest of the petitioner(s) is required from the law enforcing agencies at the federal level and within the Capital Territory of Islamabad. The said record shall be provided to the petitioner(s) at the earliest, but not later than seven days from the date of the application,” it declared. The court added that once the records were provided to the petitioner(s), he should approach or surrender within three days before the appropriate court for bail or any other legal remedy, if available. The high court later clubbed petitions of several other lawmakers with those of Senator Mashal Azam and MNAs Atif Khan and Shahid Khattak. In these cases, federal prosecutor general Ghulam Sarwar Nehung had represented the chief commissioner and contended that the petitioner (Asad Qaiser) had filed repeated petitions for the same relief without disclosing the fate of the earlier adjudications. His main concern was that the present petitioner as well as those in connected matters, obtained protective orders from the court (high court) but, pursuant to such orders, failed to approach or surrender before the appropriate forum. Consequently, he claimed, they remained on bail before arrest for a considerable period of time without joining the investigation agencies in other provinces. He submitted that there was no uniform policy of this court regarding the grant of omnibus bail (bail in all cases orders or protective bail, and petitions filed by the same petitioner for bail before arrest or omnibus bail were placed before different benches, therefore such practice was contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in one of its cases (PLD 1986 SC 173). Contrary to his claims, the lawyers representing the petitioners had insisted that despite directions of the court, the respondents had failed to provide details of all required FIRs. They added that the conduct of the respondents had caused the matter to be delayed. Published in Dawn, December 21st, 2025",

For abundant caution, it is further clarified that this order shall not be used, directly or indirectly, to enable, justify or facilitate the petitioner(s) participation in any protest, demonstration, anti-state activity, or any event of a similar nature,” reads a ruling by a bench consisting of Justice Syed Arshad Ali and Justice Mohammad Faheem Wali in multiple cases. It declared that any misuse, abuse or attempt to extend the scope of that order beyond the limited purpose for which it had been granted would expose the petitioner(s) to appropriate legal consequences, including, but not limited to, proceedings in accordance with the law. The court issued these directives in a four-page detailed decision on the petition of former National Assembly speaker and current MNA Asad Qaiser and other PTI leaders. Bench declares that relief granted only for approaching relevant courts Qaiser had sought details of the cases registered against him by law-enforcement agencies and the grant of protective bail in those cases. The other petitions were filed by MPAs Sohail Afridi and former chief minister Ali Amin Gandapur, MNAs Sheikh Waqas Akram, Naseem Shah, Faisal Amin Khan, Shandana Gulzar, Noorul Haq Qadri and Yousaf Ali, Senator Khurram Zeeshan and several other PTI leaders. On the plea of Islamabad’s chief commissioner, the bench had referred all these connected petitions to the chief justice on Dec 9for constituting a larger bench for hearing. The bench ruled that since certain crucial issues, as identified by the federal prosecutor general as well as other counsel, were involved in this matter, the office was directed to place the matter before the chief justice of this court for the formation of a larger bench. In the detailed order, the bench directed the Islamabad chief commissioner to act as focal person between the petitioners and the law-enforcement agencies at federal level as well as within Islamabad. It declared: “The petitioner(s) in the present case, as well as in the connected cases, shall approach the said office through an application, either directly or through an advocate, seeking information regarding their involvement in criminal cases within three days of the receipt of this order.” “Upon receipt of such application, the worthy Chief Commissioner, Islamabad, shall procure the record of all criminal cases in which the arrest of the petitioner(s) is required from the law enforcing agencies at the federal level and within the Capital Territory of Islamabad. The said record shall be provided to the petitioner(s) at the earliest, but not later than seven days from the date of the application,” it declared. The court added that once the records were provided to the petitioner(s), he should approach or surrender within three days before the appropriate court for bail or any other legal remedy, if available. The high court later clubbed petitions of several other lawmakers with those of Senator Mashal Azam and MNAs Atif Khan and Shahid Khattak. In these cases, federal prosecutor general Ghulam Sarwar Nehung had represented the chief commissioner and contended that the petitioner (Asad Qaiser) had filed repeated petitions for the same relief without disclosing the fate of the earlier adjudications. His main concern was that the present petitioner as well as those in connected matters, obtained protective orders from the court (high court) but, pursuant to such orders, failed to approach or surrender before the appropriate forum. Consequently, he claimed, they remained on bail before arrest for a considerable period of time without joining the investigation agencies in other provinces. He submitted that there was no uniform policy of this court regarding the grant of omnibus bail (bail in all cases orders or protective bail, and petitions filed by the same petitioner for bail before arrest or omnibus bail were placed before different benches, therefore such practice was contrary to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in one of its cases (PLD 1986 SC 173). Contrary to his claims, the lawyers representing the petitioners had insisted that despite directions of the court, the respondents had failed to provide details of all required FIRs. They added that the conduct of the respondents had caused the matter to be delayed. Published in Dawn, December 21st, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "Kinno grading in process at a plant in Sargodha.—Photo by the writer LAHORE: Despite being among the world’s largest producers of citrua, Pakistan is set to export only 400,000-450,000 tonnes of kinno during the 2025-26 season, well below its estimated potential of 700,000-800,000 tonnes, as growers and exporters struggle with high freight costs, border restrictions and the absence of effective government facilitation. During the 2024-25 season, kinno exports stood at around 350,000-400,000 tonnes, with Russia, Indonesia, the UAE, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and Central Asian states as major destinations. For the current season, a slight improvement is expected due to better fruit size and quality in Sargodha and adjoining areas, but structural issues continue to cap growth. Former MPA and large kinno orchard owner Faisal Cheema said the crisis has deepened despite an excellent crop. “By the grace of God, this year’s kinno crop is outstanding in both quantity and quality, but it has become a pattern that whenever the crop is good, it goes to waste. The Afghan border issue has been hurting us for the last couple of years, while the recent goods transporters’ strike caused further damages as we failed to meet some export orders due to unavailability of reefer containers,” he said. Market prices have collapsed sharply during the season and orchard owners, out of panic, are selling their produce at whatever price is being offered. At the start of packing for Dubai exports, large size kinno fetched Rs120-125 per kg and smaller fruit Rs90-95 per kg, rates that held until Nov 30. By Dec 10, prices fell to Rs100 per kg for large fruit and Rs70 per kg for small. Between Dec 10 and 15, factories sold large fruit at Rs85-90 per kg and small at Rs55-60 per kg. After Dec 15, the situation became alarming, with factories offering barely Rs75 per kg for large fruit and Rs35-40 per kg for small — despite near-total buyer apathy. Kabul border dispute and unstable markets put citrus sector at risk According to industry estimates, traders are selling kinno to factories at Rs1,400-1,500 per maund, while factories have cut packing speeds drastically, daily operations halved from ten to five pickings causing repeated topping of orchards and severe damage to trees. Sajid Tarar, a former president of the Sargodha Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned that border closures have brought the export chain to a standstill. “Over 100 factories did not open at all due to the Afghan border issue. Of the remaining units, most were already operating at around half capacity, and now closures are accelerating. Nearly 50 units are shut, with many more on the brink,” he said, cautioning that up to 800,000 workers could face unemployment if the crisis persists. In a hint to the disturbing Afghan market, he said that some fruit had been going to Afghanistan through Iran, but the tensions on borders created a hostile atmosphere in Afghanistan against Pakistani products and a consignment of bananas was damaged by some people in the markets there. Cold storages across Sargodha are reported to be 80-90 per cent full, putting kinnow worth millions of dollars at risk of spoilage. Growers fear losses of Rs8-10 billion, with ripple effects likely to hit future crops, including wheat and sugarcane, due to shrinking farm resources. Stakeholders have urged the government to take immediate action by finding alternative international markets and routes for fruits, subsidising logistics, resolving border issue, and supporting exporters. “Saving kinno exports means saving farmers — and strengthening the national economy,” Faisal Cheema emphasised.

      "title_orig": "Dollar shortage continues as exchanges run dry",
      "summary_orig": "KARACHI: Despite authorities’ best efforts, there is a dire shortage of dollars in the open market, and many currency exchanges are “only selling what they buy”, causing consternation among those planning to travel abroad for the holidays, or in the new year. Visits to multiple exchange outlets across different parts of the metropolis revealed that currency dealers are facing a dearth of greenbacks in their accounts. Some have stopped selling dollars altogether, while others are rationing their supply, only allowing customers to purchase up to $100 at a time. In addition, a small number of exchanges only have old-design dollar notes in stock. These are not of much use to travellers who wish to exchange greenbacks for the local currency of their destination. As a result, a number of passengers have been forced to purchase exotic foreign currencies in Pakistan, leading to them getting a ‘bad deal’ in terms of the exchange rate. One such passenger, who was travelling to Malaysia at the end of November, told Dawn that they were unable to buy dollars at the airport, which they hoped to exchange for ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Just hours before their flight, they settled for an exorbitant exchange rate in the open market: Rs74.5 for a ringgit. Strict regulatory measures compound the situation; exchanges are only selling what they buy According to them, they were worse off as the exchange rate should have been less than Rs70. Mid-market exchange rate (MMER) data available on Wise confirms this speculation for the given period, as it lists the MMER for a ringgit at roughly Rs68. But the buck doesn’t stop at travellers. In fact, another group of non-speculative buyers has been hit hard by the shortage: students. Dawn spoke to a Lahore resident who was unable to buy dollars even after visiting 11 different exchange companies to support their siblings’ education expenses. This shortage, some argue, can also be attributed to recent changes to SOPs surrounding the exchange of currencies. Biometric verification and the requirement of an original CNIC were among the changes previously made. But recent changes include an SBP circular dated November 14, mandating exchange companies to issue cheques to customers wishing to buy dollars for deposit into their foreign currency accounts. A more recent circular adds another layer of verification that is not easily accessible for women who wear veil: facial recognition. Even with these new SOPs, one exchange we spoke to was willing to accept a digital CNIC, after initially hesitating to sell even a single greenback. While three other exchanges that initially hesitated became willing to sell up to $100, provided an original CNIC was available. In contrast, only five exchanges visited by Dawn , were willing to sell dollars without hesitation, whereas seven exchanges outright refused to sell dollars. An employee highlighted the shortage and the lack of customers willing to supply greenbacks to the open market. Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan acknowledged the difference in demand and supply, said when a currency was not available, the exchanges were supposed to “note down customer information” and arrange it for them. Impact of digital currencies Despite shortage at the exchanges, dollars are still becoming more accessible than ever, through digital currencies pegged to the dollar, a type of transaction that is currently against SBP instructions for banks. Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said that “no bank can operationally engage with stablecoins or crypto rails” until SBP issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework, which can only happen once Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) published its detailed guidelines. Mr Bostan also noted his concerns related to illegal activity moving towards unregulated crypto rails, and cited the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users who may have lost money as a result of the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value. Experts previously warned that this shortage indicates illegal operators entering the market, and “while smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely”.

      "summary_en": "KARACHI: Despite authorities’ best efforts, there is a dire shortage of dollars in the open market, and many currency exchanges are “only selling what they buy”, causing consternation among those planning to travel abroad for the holidays, or in the new year. Visits to multiple exchange outlets across different parts of the metropolis revealed that currency dealers are facing a dearth of greenbacks in their accounts. Some have stopped selling dollars altogether, while others are rationing their supply, only allowing customers to purchase up to $100 at a time. In addition, a small number of exchanges only have old-design dollar notes in stock. These are not of much use to travellers who wish to exchange greenbacks for the local currency of their destination. As a result, a number of passengers have been forced to purchase exotic foreign currencies in Pakistan, leading to them getting a ‘bad deal’ in terms of the exchange rate. One such passenger, who was travelling to Malaysia at the end of November, told Dawn that they were unable to buy dollars at the airport, which they hoped to exchange for ringgit in Kuala Lumpur. Just hours before their flight, they settled for an exorbitant exchange rate in the open market: Rs74.5 for a ringgit. Strict regulatory measures compound the situation; exchanges are only selling what they buy According to them, they were worse off as the exchange rate should have been less than Rs70. Mid-market exchange rate (MMER) data available on Wise confirms this speculation for the given period, as it lists the MMER for a ringgit at roughly Rs68. But the buck doesn’t stop at travellers. In fact, another group of non-speculative buyers has been hit hard by the shortage: students. Dawn spoke to a Lahore resident who was unable to buy dollars even after visiting 11 different exchange companies to support their siblings’ education expenses. This shortage, some argue, can also be attributed to recent changes to SOPs surrounding the exchange of currencies. Biometric verification and the requirement of an original CNIC were among the changes previously made. But recent changes include an SBP circular dated November 14, mandating exchange companies to issue cheques to customers wishing to buy dollars for deposit into their foreign currency accounts. A more recent circular adds another layer of verification that is not easily accessible for women who wear veil: facial recognition. Even with these new SOPs, one exchange we spoke to was willing to accept a digital CNIC, after initially hesitating to sell even a single greenback. While three other exchanges that initially hesitated became willing to sell up to $100, provided an original CNIC was available. In contrast, only five exchanges visited by Dawn , were willing to sell dollars without hesitation, whereas seven exchanges outright refused to sell dollars. An employee highlighted the shortage and the lack of customers willing to supply greenbacks to the open market. Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan Chairman Malik Bostan acknowledged the difference in demand and supply, said when a currency was not available, the exchanges were supposed to “note down customer information” and arrange it for them. Impact of digital currencies Despite shortage at the exchanges, dollars are still becoming more accessible than ever, through digital currencies pegged to the dollar, a type of transaction that is currently against SBP instructions for banks. Pakistan Banks Association Secretary Mir Nejib Rahman said that “no bank can operationally engage with stablecoins or crypto rails” until SBP issues the relevant regulations and supervisory framework, which can only happen once Pakistan Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (PVARA) published its detailed guidelines. Mr Bostan also noted his concerns related to illegal activity moving towards unregulated crypto rails, and cited the PVARA chairman’s references to 40 million crypto users who may have lost money as a result of the recent drop in Bitcoin’s value. Experts previously warned that this shortage indicates illegal operators entering the market, and “while smuggling has been largely controlled, hoarding is becoming increasingly likely”.

      "summary_orig": "• PTI to challenge guilty ruling in high court, as ex-PM says ‘not surprised’ • Asad says left with no option but ‘resistance’; Raja insists verdict not based on evidence ISLAMABAD: As a court sentenced him to jail in the Toshakhana-II case, former prime minister Imran Khan on Saturday issued a call for a nationwide protest besides announcing his intention to challenge the verdict in the Islamabad High Court. The PTI chief does not have access to his social media handles in jail. “I have sent a message to [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister] Sohail Afridi to prepare for the street movement. The entire nation will have to rise for its rights,” he said as per the account of the conversation between the PTI leader and his lawyer posted on X. He said his sentence in this case did not come as a surprise, but he had asked his legal team to move the high court against the decision. “Like the baseless decisions and sentences of the last three years, the Toshakhana-II decision is also nothing new to me. This decision was given in haste by the judge without any evidence and without fulfilling the legal requirements,” he said, adding that his legal team was “not even heard”. The PTI chief said it was inevitable for the Insaf Lawyers Forum and the legal community to “come to the front foot” for the supremacy of law and the restoration of the Constitution. He said that without justice, economic development was not possible. ‘Political revenge’ The PTI, in a statement, called the sentence “blatantly unconstitutional, illegal, malicious and the worst form of political revenge and a textbook case of victimisation”. The PTI leaders alleged that the conviction was merely an attempt to extend the incarceration of Imran Khan and provide temporary relief to a “petrified ruling clique”. They stated that the rule of law had been buried in Pakistan, with political revenge being systematically carried out through a “subservient” judiciary. Addressing a press conference alongside PTI senior leader Asad Qaiser, PTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja stated that the PTI founder had a meeting with his lead counsel, Barrister Salman Safdar, in the courtroom and conveyed a message to the nation. He made his position absolutely clear, stating, “I am standing firm and resolute and will not seek an apology from anyone, come what may.” Salman Raja alleged that the case was based solely on promissory notes and lacked credible evidence. “They have no witnesses except the person whom the PTI founder himself brought forward,” he said. Mr Raja described the case as absurd and based on the weakest possible testimony. “A person stands up and says pressure was exerted on him, and you accept that as evidence,” he added, in an apparent reference to a witness statement in the case. Mr Qaiser stated that the current circumstances leave no option other than resistance. He emphasised that the resistance would be peaceful, democratic, and grounded in constitutional principles. He further asserted that PTI was seeking justice for its founder and would continue its struggle until it was served. PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram stated that even Imran Khan’s family was not allowed inside the jail, where a “kangaroo” court announced the verdict. The sentence was the second for the same charge, which was a clear violation of the Constitution, criminal law and the international principle of double jeopardy, he said. ‘Pre-written script’ Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan, while speaking to the media, criticised the verdict and alleged that decisions against him were being delivered under a “pre-written script”. Ms Khan claimed that those behind the cases were “not intelligent people” and that she failed to understand their scripts. “Even at night, I felt they wanted to announce the verdict quickly, taking advantage of the foggy weather,” she remarked, questioning the logic behind the timing of the decision. “What difference does it make whether you sentence them to 10 years or 14 years? Earlier, you already gave them 14 years,” she said. “Our patience and the patience of the people has run out,” she said, adding that the alleged plan was to announce a new decision every six months. “The people of Pakistan will not allow this to happen anymore,” she warned. According to Ms Khan, the PTI founder’s family had been expecting such a verdict for the past two months. She also questioned the legality of the treatment being meted out to Bushra Bibi, asking why she had been kept in “illegal solitary confinement”. Separately, PTI leader Omar Ayub also condemned the judgement. In a post on X, he said that the sentences awarded to the former premier and his wife were those of a “kangaroo court”. “There is no rule of law in Pakistan,” Mr Ayub added.
