      "summary_orig": "The United States is trying to get Bagram air base in Afghanistan back, President Donald Trump said on Thursday during a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer. Trump is on an official state visit to the UK — his second state trip to Britain — where he signed a technology agreement with Starmer earlier today. “We’re trying to get it back,” Trump said, referring to Bagram. “It’s one of the biggest airbases in the world; we gave it to them for nothing. We’re trying to get it back. “One of the reasons we want the base, as you know, is it’s an hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons.” Bagram Air Base served as the linchpin for US operations in the rugged country, where the long war against the Taliban and their Al Qaeda allies was fought with air strikes and resupply missions from the airfield. The historic Soviet-built airstrip was the main base for American forces in Afghanistan following the September 11, 2001, attacks, up until their 2021 withdrawal , which led to a takeover by the Afghan Taliban. In July 2021, all US and Nato troops left Afghanistan’s biggest air base, signalling the complete withdrawal of foreign forces from the country after two decades of war. A week after the US withdrawal, Bagram buzzed again with activity as Afghan forces settled into the vast premises, complete with its runways, barracks, control towers and hospital. Trump, Starmer sign tech deal to seal ‘unbreakable bond’ Before the joint presser, Trump and Starmer signed a huge tech deal, which the British PM hailed as “the biggest investment package of its kind in British history by a country mile”. Britain’s work in wooing the unpredictable Trump on his second state visit seemed to have paid off as he and Starmer signed the partnership, boosting ties in artificial intelligence, quantum computing and nuclear energy. Britain’s Prime Minister Keir Starmer (R) and US President Donald Trump (L) shake hands as the pair sign a tech deal at Chequers, in Aylesbury, central England, on September 18. — AFP Trump said the deal was “very big”, and added of US relations with key Nato ally Britain that, “It’s an unbreakable bond we have regardless of what we’re doing today.” The deal comes on the back of pledges of £150 billion ($205bn) of investment into the UK from American giants, including Microsoft, Google and Blackstone. Trump disagrees with UK on recognising Palestinian state Continuing the press conference, Trump said he disagreed with Starmer over recognising a Palestinian state, speaking following their bilateral meeting. “I have a disagreement with the prime minister on that score, one of our few disagreements, actually,” Trump said in response to a question during the press conference. Meanwhile, Starmer said he and Trump agreed on the ultimate aim of peace in the region. “We absolutely agree on the need for peace and a road map, because the situation in Gaza is intolerable,” he said. US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer hold a press conference at Chequers in Aylesbury, England on September 18. — Reuters When pressed about reports he was waiting for Trump to leave the country before formally recognising a Palestinian state this weekend, Starmer said: “I made my position clear at the end of July as to the timing, which has got nothing to do with this state visit. “I’ve discussed it with the president, as you would expect, amongst two leaders who respect each other and like each other and want to bring about a better solution in the best way that we can,” he added.",

      "summary_orig": "Fresh witness statements have come to light in relation to the Toshakhana-2 case on a Bulgari jewellery set against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, alleging that the appraiser was pressured into undervaluing the ornaments. The development comes three days after a special judge central completed the cross-examination of the two key witnesses, an appraiser named Sohaib Abbasi and the former prime minister’s personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, in an over six-hour-long proceeding inside Adiala Jail. The case pertains to Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi retaining an expensive Bulgari jewellery set gifted by the Saudi royal family — including a necklace, earrings, bracelets, and rings — at a low price, causing significant loss to the exchequer. One of the witnesses, Sohaib Abbasi, confessed to undervaluing the Bulgari set at Rs5 million. He did so under the pressure of Imran Khan’s former personal secretary, Inamullah Shah, he claimed. Shah is the other key witness who has testified in the case. In his testimony, Abbasi said that he was “handed over the responsibility of the assessment of the set on May 25, 2022 by the Section Officer of [the] Cabinet Division.” Abbasi went on to say that Shah visited him and told him “that the two accused facing trial want to retain the jewellery set”, demanding that the assessment should be upto Rs5m. Abbasi alleged that he was told by Shah that he would be blacklisted from every government department if he refused to cooperate, so he undervalued the jewellery set and submitted a false report. Abbasi said that he joined the investigation on May 23, 2024 and requested a pardon in the case for undervaluing the jewellery set. Shah confirmed the allegation, stating that, “I asked Sohaib Abbasi to make [an] undervalued assessment (of the set) and he agreed to that,” adding that he remained in Abbasi’s office for 30-45 minutes during his visit for the jewellery set under question. The copies of both testimonies are available with Dawn.com. Shah also told the court that he was receiving double salaries while working for PTI and the government at the same time. In his testimony, he said, “I was appointed Comptroller of the PM house [from] 2019 to 2021,” but then Shah reveals that, “In that very time, I was also receiving salary additionally from PTI Central Secretariat.” As per Shah’s testimony, he was removed from his post in the same year, not because of receiving double salary, but “due to Bushra Bibi’s disapproval”. Shah believed that Bushra Bibi suspected Shah’s brother of having close ties with former PTI leader Jahangir Tareen. In July last year, an Islamabad court prohibited the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from pursuing the Toshakhana reference against Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, transferring the case to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) court. The case was transferred to a Special Judge Central, who will also decide on Imran and Bushra Bibi’s bail applications. Imran Khan, imprisoned since August 2023, is currently serving a sentence at the Adiala Jail in a £190 million corruption case, along with his wife. He also faces pending trials under the Anti-Terrorism Act related to the protests of May 9, 2023.",

Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. A military confrontation between India and Pakistan recently occurred in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians . Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities. In a statement issued on today’s development, the Indian MEA said: “We will study the implications of this development for our national security as well as for regional and global stability. The government remains committed to protecting India’s national interests and ensuring comprehensive national security in all domains.” It added that the Indian government was already aware that the development, which it said “formalises a long-standing arrangement between the two countries”, was under consideration. Pakistan and India have fought three major wars since the two countries were carved out of British colonial India in 1947. After they both acquired nuclear weapons in the late 1990s, their conflicts have been more limited in scale because of the danger of nuclear assets coming into play. According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”. “[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details. Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure , when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram. In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms. In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In February, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges. The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella, though finer details of the agreement were not made public. For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider. For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting the Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time. Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses. Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.",

      "summary_orig": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) rose by 1,700 points on Thursday to settle near the all-time high of 158,000 on the back of increased investor confidence after the signing of a mutual defence pact with Saudi Arabia. The benchmark KSE-100 index surged by 1,775.65 points, or 1.14 per cent, to close at 157,953.46 — its highest level in history. Pakis­tan and Saudi Arabia entered into a landmark mutual defence agreement, under which any aggression against one state will be considered an attack on both. The ‘Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement’ was signed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad Bin Salman at the Al-Yamamah Palace in Riyadh on Wednesday. Talking to Dawn.com , Awais Ashraf, research director at AKD Securities, said the pact had “bolstered investor confidence”, driving the KSE-100 Index to an all-time high close with the second-highest trading volumes in today’s session. “This agreement is expected to pave the way for enhanced cooperation with Saudi Arabia, including greater export of skilled labour and increased prospects for investment across various sectors of Pakistan.” According to the text of the joint statement, issued simultaneously by Islamabad and Riyadh at the end of PM Shehbaz’s day-long state visit, the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”. “[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said, without going into details. Importantly, the text underscored that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both”. The timing of the accord, coming on the heels of an Arab summit that signalled a shift towards collective security — in the wake of Israel’s attack on Qatar — hints that it is rooted in current world affairs and reflects the defence concerns of both countries. The agreement marks the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence ties in decades. Cooperation between the two states dates back to 1967 and deepened after the 1979 Grand Mosque seizure , when Pakistani special forces helped Saudi troops reclaim Masjid al-Haram. In 1982, the two sides institutionalised security ties through a Bilateral Security Cooperation Agreement that enabled Pakistani training, advisory support and deployments on Saudi soil. At times, as many as 20,000 Pakistani troops were stationed in the kingdom, and Saudi Arabia became a key purchaser of Pakistani-made arms. In recent years, the partnership has gained urgency amid regional instability. In Feb, a meeting of the Joint Military Cooperation Committee in Riyadh pledged to expand training and exchanges. The new pact formalises commitments that had long existed in practice, creating what some analysts saw as a de facto joint defensive umbrella though finer details of the agreement were not made public. For Pakistan, the agreement offers both strategic and economic benefits. It secures vital Saudi investment and funding at a time of fiscal strain, while reinforcing Islamabad’s standing as a pan-Islamic security provider. For Saudi Arabia, it strengthens defences against threats from Iran, Houthi militias and regional turbulence caused by Israel’s genocidal actions in Gaza and aggression against other countries in the neighbourhood. The Israeli attack targeting Hamas delegation in Doha heightened the urgency for this agreement that had been under discussion for some time. Pakistan’s earlier defence alignments, such as Cold War-era agreements with the United States and those under Seato and Cento, have long since eroded. Islamabad’s partnerships with China, Turkiye and other Gulf states remain important but lack binding mutual defence clauses. Against this backdrop, Wednesday’s signing represented Pakistan’s most consequential formal defence commitment in decades, tying its security role inextricably to the evolving strategic architecture of the Gulf.",

      "summary_orig": "The United States Embassy in New Delhi has revoked and subsequently denied visas for some Indian business executives and corporate leaders based on their involvement in trafficking fentanyl precursors, it said in a statement on Thursday. Fentanyl precursors refer to the basic or parent chemicals that form fentanyl, a leading cause of US overdose deaths. The statement from the embassy did not name the people affected, but a spokesperson said they were Indian nationals. Indian government officials have been closely cooperating with US counterparts to combat the challenge of drug trafficking, the US embassy added in its statement. India’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment on the US visa measures. US President Donald Trump, whose punitive 50 per cent tariffs on Indian imports hurt bilateral ties, has previously imposed additional levies on imports from China, Mexico and Canada, saying they facilitated the flow of fentanyl into the US. In a statement to the US Congress this week, Trump listed India as one of 23 major drug transit or illicit drug-producing countries, though he added the presence of any country on the list was not necessarily a reflection of its government’s counter-drug efforts.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan and Saudi Arabia signed a landmark defence agreement on Wednesday during a visit to the latter country by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, marking what is being considered the most significant upgrade in Pakistan-Saudi defence relations in decades. The announcement was made in a joint statement by Islamabad and Riyadh. The statement said the pact “reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world”. “[It] aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement said. While not many details have been shared yet, the key driver of Wednesday’s agreement appears to be the principle that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an aggression against both.“ The two countries have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. It is important to note that the agreement comes in the wake of Israel’s recent strike on Qatar, which has raised concerns for the overall security of the Middle East. Former envoy Maleeha Lodhi termed the agreement a “significant development”, noting that it has “far-reaching implications” for both countries. Speaking to Geo News , the former ambassador said, “Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have been engaged in a defence cooperation for a long time, and their diplomatic relations have always remained strong; however, with this agreement, the relationship has been shifted to a qualitatively different place.” “At this point, it is clear that Pakistan has taken up  the role of a security provider, not just for Saudi Arabia but for the Middle East.” Lodhi believed that “it is important to take into consideration the timing and the context of this agreement, since in the aftermath of Israeli aggression against Qatar, Arab countries have started to look elsewhere for security guarantees.” “The United States’ role as a security guarantor has come under scrutiny as of late, and its credibility has been severely damaged,” Lodhi said. “The agreement may have been in the works for some time, but it is important to look at the context.” She added that, “currently, it is hard to say any more, and a full assessment can only be made when more details come to light.” On the question of India’s place in the situation, she said: “It is clear that if Pakistan continues to strengthen its defence like this, its opponent cannot be happy about it, but we have to wait and see what sort of reaction will come from India.” South Asia Analyst Michael Kugelman, in a post on X, said that, with the inking of the agreement, Pakistan now finds itself “in a very good place”. Kugelman noted that, “This pact would not deter India from attacking Pakistan. But with 3-key powers — China, Turkey, and now KSA — fully on [Pakistan’s] side, [Pakistan] is in a very good place”. Former Senator Mushahid Hussain, on the question of India’s place in the situation, said: “India is in a state of shock, they are taken by surprise.” Mushahid, while speaking to Geo News , hailed the agreement as “the single most important military and diplomatic initiative in the past 50 years, after the Lahore Islamic summit.” Noting the significance of the agreement, he pointed out that “this is the first defence deal between two muslim countries.” Mushahid added that “Saudi Arabia is not just any muslim country but one of the richest countries in the world, with a strong diplomatic influence.” On the matter of Israel,  Hussain noted that the pact will serve as a deterrent for Israel; “With Pakistan’s military capability and Arab economic strength combined, Israel can’t do anything.” According to the former senator, the recent four-day military conflict between India and Pakistan “showed our will, skill and capability that we can defend our Arab friends just as well,” positing Pakistan as a regional security guarantor. He also speculated that the agreement could have implications for terrorist elements within the country, particularly the TTP. Former diplomat Hussain Haqani, in a post on X, noted the use of the term “strategic” in the agreement, saying, “‘Strategic Mutual Defense Agreement’ implies that it [covers] nuclear and missile defence. Pakistan has always used the term ‘strategic assets’ for its nuclear & missile programs.” In a separate tweet, he said, “Most likely, Pakistan will now be able to buy US weapons it needs, with Saudi money, which [the] Trump administration seems willing to sell. Similar purchases occurred in the 1970s when the US Congress was unwilling to approve loans under Foreign Military Funding (FMF) for Pakistan.” Analyst Uzair Younus noted that the agreement has cemented “Pakistan’s role as a net security provider in the Arabian peninsula.” Journalist Iftikhar Firdous branded the pact “symbolically powerful and strategically consequential,” saying that Pakistan will now be seen as a “direct deterrent to Israel”. “For Saudi Arabia, it’s a hedge against uncertainty and a signal of independence. Even though the pact does not officially include nuclear guarantees [at least from the available information], Pakistan’s arsenal casts a deterrence shadow.” “This gives Saudi Arabia a de facto “nuclear umbrella” without formally breaching non-proliferation norms,” he said, cautioning that the move “increases the chance that local conflicts could spiral into regionalised wars with nuclear undertones.” The agreement has brought Pakistan into the Arab world and its politics “like never before,” he said.

A day ago, the ISPR had issued another statement, saying that the armed forces had eliminated five “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Khuzdar earlier this week. Yesterday, two police stations and a Levies station had also come under attack in Balochistan’s Sherani district. In those attacks, a policeman was martyred and two Levies personnel were injured. On September 12, the ISPR said troops had also killed four “Indian sponsored terrorists” during an IBO in Balochistan’s Mastung.",

      "summary": "Four terrorists “belonging to Indian proxy” were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Khuzdar district, the military’s media wing said on Thursday. “On September 17 2025, security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in the Khuzdar district of Balochistan, on reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Hindustan ,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said. The state has designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan. The ISPR statement said that during the operation, “own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location”, adding that “after an intense fire exchange, four Indian sponsored terrorists were sent to hell”. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from slain terrorists, the ISPR said. The terrorists were “actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in the area”, it added. “Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area,” the statement read. “Security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added.

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan captain Salman Agha said his team were ready to face India in the next round of the Asia Cup on Sunday after last week’s group-stage match between the arch-rivals ended in acrimony when the Indian side refused to shake hands. Pakistan beat United Arab Emirates in their final Group A game on Wednesday to advance to the Super Fours stage, where they will also play two teams from Group B in a round robin format. Bilateral cricket between India and Pakistan has been suspended since 2013, and they play each other only in multi-team tournaments. “We are ready, we are ready for any challenge,” Salman said after their 41-run victory against UAE. “We just want to play good cricket. If we play good cricket, like we have played in the last few months, I think we’ll be good against any side.” Fakhar Zaman made 50, but Pakistan’s frontline batters disappointed against the UAE’s modest attack, with opener Saim Ayub falling for his third successive duck in the tournament. Salman acknowledged they had to bat better. “We got the job done, but we still need to improve our batting in the middle order,” Salman said. “That’s been a concern and something we need to work on.” India had cruised to a seven-wicket victory over Pakistan last weekend in the first cricket match between the sides since a four-day military conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours in May. While the match itself passed without incident, there was no shaking of hands between the captains at the toss or among the players at the end. India skipper Suryakumar Yadav dedicated their victory to the armed forces back home, which was seen as politicisation of the game. The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) called for match referee Andy Pycroft’s immediate removal for a code of conduct “violation” and considered withdrawing from the tournament before going ahead with Wednesday’s match. The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Suryakumar Yadav before the match. The matter was settled after the PCB said ahead of yesterday’s match that Pycroft had apologised to the manager and captain of the Green Shirts over a controversy during the recent Pakistan-India match. India and Pakistan could meet for a third time at the tournament if they both reach the September 28 final.",

The commitment was made during a high-level meeting chaired by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Wednesday. The plan, aligned with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), seeks to enhance maritime cooperation with China while promoting economic connectivity with Afghanistan, Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The framework emphasises infrastructure development, including the expansion of Gwadar Port, completion of Free Zone Stage II, and acceleration of East Bay Expressway Phase II to improve inland accessibility. A key component is the integration of the airport with the port to support multi-modal transit and regional logistics. The plan also supports the adoption of electronic data interchange systems and smart port technologies to integrate Gwadar with Chinese and international shipping networks. Development of port-related industries, cold storage facilities, and warehousing is part of the strategy to facilitate transshipment and regional trade. Govt plans strategic leap with port and airport integration Beyond logistics, the framework outlines initiatives for scientific cooperation, industrial development, and maritime tourism. Proposed projects include joint marine science research centres, CPEC-linked industrial parks for fisheries, shipbuilding and aquaculture, as well as tourism ventures along Balochistan’s coast. Education and human resource development are positioned as cross-cutting priorities, with proposed academic partnerships and training exchanges between Pakistani and Chinese institutions to develop skilled manpower in logistics, port management, and fisheries. The plan aligns with the Belt and Road Initiative’s “green energy and ocean” objectives, emphasising sustainable use of marine resources and environmental protection.

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: Pakistan has warned the UN Security Council that terrorist groups operating from sanctuaries inside Afghanistan pose the gravest threat to its national security, urging stronger international action against networks using both physical and digital platforms to target the country. Ambassador Asim Ifti­khar Ahmed, Pakistan’s permanent representative to the UN, told a Council meeting on Afghanistan on Tuesday that entities like Al Qaeda, IS-Khorasan, TTP, the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) and Baloch insurgent groups such as the BLA and Majeed Brigade continue to operate with impunity from across the border. “We have credible evidence of collaboration among these groups through joint training, illicit weapons trade, refuge to terrorists and coordinated attacks,” he said. More than 60 terrorist camps function as hubs for infiltration, targeting civilians, security forces and development projects inside Pakistan, he added. The envoy said the threat extended to cyberspace, where nearly 70 propaganda accounts traced to Afghan IP addresses were spreading extremist messaging. “Curb­ing these networks requires full cooperation from social media platforms with governments,” he stressed. Ambassador Ahmed said Pakistan and China had jointly asked the Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions Committee to designate the BLA and Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations. He urged the Council to act swiftly on the request to curb their terrorist activities. He also pointed to the TTP, describing it as the largest UN-designated group on Afghan soil with nearly 6,000 fighters. Pakistan, he said, had thwarted multiple infiltration attempts, seizing caches of sophisticated military equipment abandoned by international forces during their withdrawal from Afghanistan. “These efforts come at a heavy price … just this month, 12 Pakistani soldiers were martyred in a single incident,” he noted. He said that while four years of Taliban rule had ended decades of civil war, the country remained mired in sanctions, poverty, narcotics and human rights concerns. He lamented that the UN’s 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan had received only 27pc of its required $2.42 billion. The envoy reminded the Council that Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades, often with inadequate international assistance. Published in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",
