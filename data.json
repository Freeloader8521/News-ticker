      "summary_orig": "Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Saturday said the riverine (katcha) areas of Rahim Yar Khan and Rajanpur districts had been “100 per cent cleared” of dacoits during security operations carried out over the past few weeks. “It was a no-go area for the state, police, Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD), and other agencies. The writ of the state and its authority have been restored in the area,” she said while addressing a high-level meeting following the successful operation in the riverine areas. Briefing on the operation, she said it was launched in three phases. “The first phase was launched at the end of December, in which ground operations were integrated with aerial surveillance. It targeted multi-pronged criminal activity.” “In the second phase, we cordoned off major criminal strongholds, including Mach, Katcha Rajwani, and Katcha Karachi, and brought them under control,” she said. She further said: “The third phase was the surrender phase, which continued from January 7 to February 13, during which more than 500 dacoits and criminals surrendered, including high-profile gang leaders.” Maryam shared further details of the criminal gangs, mentioning the names of “Umrani, Sikhani, Dolani, Bingyani, Lathani, and Inder,” who surrendered in the third phase of the operation. She noted that 34 criminals who surrendered had Rs10 million in bounties on their heads. CM Maryam also shared details of arms recovered during the operation, including grenade launchers, sub-machine guns, shotguns, and pistols. The Punjab chief minister also thanked Sindh Police and the government of Sindh for the successful operation, noting that law enforcement personnel “faced challenges in the tri-border areas” connecting Punjab with Balochistan and Sindh. She added that the successful operation would not have been possible without the active participation of the Sindh Police and the Sindh government. Further elaborating on the operation, she said, “Latest technology, including drones, night-vision cameras, and quad-dopters, were used in the operation. Every movement of criminals was not only digitally monitored but also tracked through aerial intelligence assets.” She added that this left the criminals with “no chance to hide or run away.” “The Punjab government deployed 1,700 personnel for the operation, with armoured personnel carriers and bullet-proof vehicles to ensure their safety.” The chief minister noted that the operation was successful because “LEAs, intelligence agencies, the police department, and the provincial government acted as one unit.” “It was a coordinated and synchronised effort,” added Maryam. The chief minister further said, “No casualty was reported in the multi-pronged operation.” “From a zone of fear, it has now become a zone where there is rule of law, the writ of the state, and the authority of the state,” she added. She thanked and congratulated former Punjab inspector general of police, Dr Usman Anwer, who “played a great role” in the operation. Speaking about the police force in border areas, she said, “For the first time in 78 years, 53 women from the tribal areas of Dera Ghazi Khan were recruited and joined the border police.” Maryam further described it as an “unprecedented achievement that we have to maintain”, adding that the government was planning a development package for the area and had established a committee for the purpose. Last month, Sindh police launched an operation against riverine bandits. Since the launch of the operation, 113 encounters have taken place with criminals in which 27 kidnappers were gunned down, 82 others were injured, and 77 were arrested, Sindh Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho said.",

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister. Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms. Tarique Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in a car on his way to the mosque to attend Friday prayer, as results project BNP’s victory in the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday. His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia , served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”. Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of the interim government of Bangladesh, shows his ballot as he arrives to vote inside a polling station during the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission. ‘Verdict of the people’ Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”. But a day later, he conceded defeat. “In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement. “We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.” Shafiqur Rahman, the emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Bangladesh, attends a press conference following the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”. The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties. China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.

Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists. Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina. “With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.” Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a referendum for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.

      "summary_en": "Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in elections on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader Tarique Rahman to become prime minister. Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising ousted the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms. Tarique Rahman, chairman of Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in a car on his way to the mosque to attend Friday prayer, as results project BNP’s victory in the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday. His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, Khaleda Zia , served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has led the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”. Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of the interim government of Bangladesh, shows his ballot as he arrives to vote inside a polling station during the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission. ‘Verdict of the people’ Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”. But a day later, he conceded defeat. “In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement. “We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.” Shafiqur Rahman, the emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Bangladesh, attends a press conference following the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. — Reuters Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”. The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties. China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the souring of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.

      "summary_orig": "LAHORE: The Punjab Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) claimed on Saturday to have arrested 26 suspected terrorists belonging to various proscribed organisations during intelligence-based operations (IBOs) conducted across the province over the past month. According to a CTD spokesperson, the department carried out 286 IBOs in different districts in view of potential terrorism threats. These operations were conducted in Lahore, Gujranwala, Sahiwal, Khushab, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Faisalabad, Jhang, Chakwal, Rajanpur, Narowal, Pakpattan and Sargodha. During the operations, 286 suspects were interrogated, and 26 terrorists were taken into custody along with arms, explosives and other prohibited material. One alleged militant affiliated with Al-Qaeda was arrested in Lahore, while four members of Fitna al-Khawarij were apprehended in Sargodha. Officials said the arrested suspects had links with the tribal areas. Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). The spokesperson said 4.9 kilograms of explosives, three improvised explosive devices (IEDs), 19 detonators, 34 feet of safety fuse wire, pamphlets and magazines of banned organisations, Prima cards, mobile phones and cash were recovered from their possession. Authorities said the suspects were planning to target important buildings in different cities to spread fear among the public. The CTD registered 25 cases against the arrested suspects under terrorism charges and started the investigation. In addition to the IBOs, the department, in coordination with local police and security agencies, conducted 4,662 combing operations across the province. During these operations, 160,009 individuals were checked, 538 suspects were arrested, 516 first information reports (FIRs) were registered and 389 recoveries were made. Last month, the CTD claimed to have arrested 49 suspected terrorists and foiled a major terror plan during a province-wide crackdown in Punjab, including a “dangerous operative” allegedly linked to India’s intelligence agency (RAW). The same month, it killed six ‘highly dangerous’ terrorists during an intelligence-based operation near Chapri Dam.",

Asked if he wanted regime change in Iran, Trump responded that it “seems like that would be the best thing that could happen.” He declined to share who he wanted to take over Iran, but said, “there are people.” “For 47 years, they’ve been talking and talking and talking,” Trump said after a military event at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. “In the meantime, we’ve lost a lot of lives while they talk. Legs blown off, arms blown off, faces blown off. We’ve been going on for a long time.” Washington wants nuclear talks with Iran to also cover the country’s ballistic missiles, support for armed groups around the region and the treatment of the Iranian people. Iran has said it is prepared to discuss curbs on its nuclear program in exchange for lifting sanctions, but has ruled out linking the issue to missiles. Trump has threatened strikes on Iran if no agreement is reached, while Tehran has vowed to retaliate, stoking fears of a wider war as the US amasses forces in the Middle East. The US targeted Iran’s nuclear facilities in strikes last year. When asked what was left to be targeted at the nuclear sites, Trump said the “dust.” He added: “If we do it, that would be the least of the mission, but we probably grab whatever is left.” Long deployments US officials described the complex process of moving military assets. The carrier Gerald R. Ford will join the carrier Abraham Lincoln, several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks. The Gerald R. Ford, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year. Asked earlier on Friday why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.” One of the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East. The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June. With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance. In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere.” The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November. While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity. Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships. Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East. The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jet and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system. The Ford also has sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation. The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.",

      "summary_orig": "WASHINGTON: An Indian national has pleaded guilty in a US federal court to plotting the assassination of Sikh activist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in New York, the US Justice Department said on Friday. Prosecutors said Nikhil Gupta , 54, admitted to charges of murder-for-hire, conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and conspiracy to commit money laundering in connection with the failed plot. He entered the plea on February 13 in the US District Court for the Southern District of New York and is scheduled to be sentenced on May 29. According to the Justice Department, Gupta acted at the direction of an Indian government employee identified as Vikash Yadav , who was employed by India’s Cabinet Secretariat, which oversees the country’s foreign intelligence service, the Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Yadav remains at large. Former Indian intelligence officer Vikash Yadav who has been charged by the US for allegedly directing a foiled plot to murder a Sikh separatist and Indian critic in New York City, at an unknown location, in this undated handout image released on October 17. — Reuters/File The department said that in May 2023, Yadav recruited Gupta to arrange the killing of Pannun, a US citizen and lawyer who advocates for an independent Sikh state known as Khalistan. Gupta contacted a person he believed to be a criminal associate, who was in fact working with US law enforcement. That individual introduced him to an undercover officer posing as a hitman. Prosecutors said the conspirators agreed on a $100,000 payment for the killing, and about $15,000 was paid in advance. The plot was disrupted before any attack took place. In a statement, US Attorney Jay Clayton said Gupta believed he could target someone in the United States “simply for exercising their American right to free speech,” but would now face justice.

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Friday nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned home from Pakistan and Iran so far in 2026. These returns add to the 5.4 million Afghans who have gone back to Afghanistan from the same two neighbouring countries since October 2023. UNHCR says it continues to observe significant numbers of Afghans returning or being forced to return from neighbouring countries under extreme difficult circumstances. The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation — particularly for women and girls — along with a fragile economy and recurring natural disasters. According to a recent report by the World Bank, rapid population growth fuelled by these returns led to a 4 per cent decline in GDP per capita in 2025. The high number of returns already this year is particularly concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of the country. UNHCR’s recent survey of returnees highlights the scale of challenges they face. Just over half reported being able to find some form of work, even if informal. For women, this figure drops to less than a quarter. More than half of returnee families report having no civil documentation — such as identity cards to prove who they are or where they are from — and more than 90 per cent are living on less than $5 a day. More than half of returnee families lack civil documentation; over 90pc live on less than $5 per day “We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns, UNHCR said. While 5 per cent of returnees surveyed say they intend to leave Afghanistan again, more than 10 per cent know a relative or community member who has already left since returning. These decisions are not driven by a desire to leave, but by the reality that many are unable to rebuild a viable and dignified life. “This year, our focus is on supporting the reintegration of returnees. We have the access, presence and experience of the last four decades in Afghanistan to deliver the assistance that communities say they most need, including protection services, housing and livelihood support, particularly for women.” Along with other UN agencies and partners, UNHCR is closely monitoring the regional situation, where asylum space continues to shrink and regulated migration pathways are narrowing. Afghans increasingly feel compelled to undertake dangerous onward journeys. “We remain prepared to respond to population movements into Afghanistan, while also continuing to call on states to uphold access to asylum, protect and assist Afghan refugees, and ensure that no one is returned to a place where their rights and freedoms are at risk,” the UN refugee agency said. Given the dire humanitarian situation and rapidly increasing population, additional support is urgently needed in 2026 to scale up assistance and invest in reintegration, enabling people to rebuild their lives with dignity, hope and stability.

More than half of returnee families report having no civil documentation — such as identity cards to prove who they are or where they are from — and more than 90 per cent are living on less than $5 a day. More than half of returnee families lack civil documentation; over 90pc live on less than $5 per day “We are deeply concerned about the sustainability of these returns, UNHCR said. While 5 per cent of returnees surveyed say they intend to leave Afghanistan again, more than 10 per cent know a relative or community member who has already left since returning. These decisions are not driven by a desire to leave, but by the reality that many are unable to rebuild a viable and dignified life. “This year, our focus is on supporting the reintegration of returnees. We have the access, presence and experience of the last four decades in Afghanistan to deliver the assistance that communities say they most need, including protection services, housing and livelihood support, particularly for women.” Along with other UN agencies and partners, UNHCR is closely monitoring the regional situation, where asylum space continues to shrink and regulated migration pathways are narrowing. Afghans increasingly feel compelled to undertake dangerous onward journeys. “We remain prepared to respond to population movements into Afghanistan, while also continuing to call on states to uphold access to asylum, protect and assist Afghan refugees, and ensure that no one is returned to a place where their rights and freedoms are at risk,” the UN refugee agency said. Given the dire humanitarian situation and rapidly increasing population, additional support is urgently needed in 2026 to scale up assistance and invest in reintegration, enabling people to rebuild their lives with dignity, hope and stability.

      "title": "Nearly 150,000 Afghans returned from Pakistan, Iran in 2026: UN",
      "summary": "ISLAMABAD: The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on Friday nearly 150,000 Afghans have returned home from Pakistan and Iran so far in 2026. These returns add to the 5.4 million Afghans who have gone back to Afghanistan from the same two neighbouring countries since October 2023. UNHCR says it continues to observe significant numbers of Afghans returning or being forced to return from neighbouring countries under extreme difficult circumstances. The speed and scale of these returns have pushed Afghanistan deeper into crisis, as the country continues to face a deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation — particularly for women and girls — along with a fragile economy and recurring natural disasters. According to a recent report by the World Bank, rapid population growth fuelled by these returns led to a 4 per cent decline in GDP per capita in 2025. The high number of returns already this year is particularly concerning given the severity of winter, with freezing temperatures and heavy snowfall across much of the country.

      "title_orig": "Iranian envoy sees no war soon, but warns ‘region should stay on its toes’",
      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Iranian Ambassador to Pakistan Reza Amiri Moghadam on Friday expressed confidence that there would not be any war against the Islamic Republic in the foreseeable future, but noted that the war of narratives and psychological warfare would continue against his country. Talking to a select group of media persons in the federal capital, he said that Iran was countering the “Zionist and Western narrative” alongside military aggression, adding that the US and Israel had a history of “deception and backstabbing”. “But they have seen the response in the recent 12-day conflict , and Israel was almost on its knees when the US intervened,” the envoy said. He added that wars were not fought merely with weapons but with national determination and the resilience of the whole society. He said that the West had used all its cards in the June 2025 attack by the Zionist regime and the recent conspiracy when riots were held, and acknowledged that the resistance movements in Lebanon, Yemen and Syria had been weakened. Moghadam urges Muslim unity, lauds Islamabad’s support for Tehran during 12-day war with Israel “While there are ups and downs in wars and broader conflicts, the US, Israel and others have seen the advanced military capabilities as well as the strength of the Iranian nation — it is less likely there will be a war soon,” Mr Moghadam said. ‘War may affect region’ “If, God forbid, war breaks out, regional countries will have to make their own decisions, as such a war would affect the entire region,” he added. He stressed that Iran had always called for greater unity and cooperation among Muslim countries since the Islamic revolution. He said that all the Muslim nations were targets on their list but the priority was different. “Today it is Iran and tomorrow it will be Saudi Arabia,” he added. Referring to the “12-day war” with Israel last year, he lauded Pakistan for supporting Iran and said that despite strong propaganda and huge networks, the Western narrative had weakened over the decades and resistance to the policies of Zionism was visible globally. He also lauded Pakistan’s stance at regional and international forums, claiming Islamabad had supported Iran diplomatically during the recent conflict. “There is a clear understanding in Pakistan that any harm to Iran is harm to Pakistan,” he added. The ambassador said that US President Donald Trump’s Peace Plan for Gaza was a mockery, as all the funding for the restructuring of the Palestinian territory would be in the hands of the American president, “who has no credibility”. “Whereas the establishment of the [international stabilisation]force [for Gaza] was a dangerous move as its target was to disarm the resistance group Hamas through Muslim countries,” he added. “Pak­istan’s decision to distance itself from this force is encouraging.” Balochistan Speaking on common issues, he expressed concern over terrorism in Balochistan province and said that it was a bilateral matter between the two countries. He observed that there was a need to look into the root causes of the problems faced by Pakistan’s Balochistan province and Iran’s adjoining Sistan province. He said that militant activities could not be countered through the use of force alone. “Lack of opportunities and discontent among the people of Pakistan’s Balochistan and Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan provinces has to be addressed through economic development and cooperation to neutralise the hostile designs of the common enemies of both countries,” he added. Women empowerment Responding to a question on the status of women in Iran, the envoy said that while Iran had laws regarding the hijab, there was no coercion in public spaces, and women continued to play a prominent role in education and professional sectors. He said that recent rallies on the occasion of the 47th anniversary of the revolution held across Iran witnessed participation by both veiled and unveiled women. “There is a law regarding the hijab in our country, and that is enforced in government offices, but there is no strictness in public gatherings,” he said, adding that similar social variations were visible in other Muslim societies, including Pakistan. He clarified that certain dress codes applied within government institutions, as was the case in many countries, but only Iran was targeted by the Western media. “Western media never showed the progress made in this regard, as women’s participation in Iran’s higher education is huge. There are more female students in Iranian universities than male students, and women are scientists and hold senior posts even in highly technical projects,” he said. “But nobody compares the representation of women across professions in Iran with other Islamic countries, or with what it was before the Islamic revolution,” Mr Moghadam added. “Nobody among us would like to see the status of women as commercial products or be named in those notorious file[s of late US convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein],” the envoy maintained, and concluded that the status of women should be seen in the context of Iran’s social laws and societal norms.

As per details, the incident occurred near the traffic police office on the Old GT Road where one Tahir Beig (60) of Chak Buzarag was going home on his motorcycle when was stopped at a picket by the traffic police. The police officials reportedly imposed a fine of Rs2,000 on the motorcyclist for not wearing a helmet. He requested the duty officials to spare him as he did not have the amount on him to pay the fine. However, the officials declined to accept his request. The man then started walking towards the GTS Chowk without his motorbike to arrange the amount and pay the fine, but he fell just a few meters away and died on the spot.

      "summary": "GUJRAT: An elderly man reportedly died of a heart attack on Friday after the traffic police imposed a fine of Rs2,000, which he was unable to pay. As per details, the incident occurred near the traffic police office on the Old GT Road where one Tahir Beig (60) of Chak Buzarag was going home on his motorcycle when was stopped at a picket by the traffic police. The police officials reportedly imposed a fine of Rs2,000 on the motorcyclist for not wearing a helmet. He requested the duty officials to spare him as he did not have the amount on him to pay the fine. However, the officials declined to accept his request. The man then started walking towards the GTS Chowk without his motorbike to arrange the amount and pay the fine, but he fell just a few meters away and died on the spot. Some eyewitnesses called Rescue 1122 and they pronounced him dead after a checkup. The rescue and police officials later shifted the body to the Aziz Bhatti Shaheed Teaching Hospital (ABSTH). A spokesperson for the Gujrat Police confirmed that the elderly man died of a heart attack after the traffic officials imposed a fine on him.

      "summary_orig": "The Pentagon is sending an aircraft carrier from the Caribbean to the Middle East, US officials said on Friday, a move that would put two carriers in the region as tensions soar between the United States and Iran. The Gerald R. Ford carrier, the United States’ newest and the world’s largest carrier, has been operating in the Caribbean with its escort ships and took part in operations in Venezuela earlier this year. Asked why a second aircraft carrier was headed to the Middle East, US President Donald Trump said: “In case we don’t make a deal, we’ll need it … if we need it, we’ll have it ready.” One of the officials, who was speaking on condition of anonymity, said the carrier would take at least a week to reach the Middle East. The Gerald R. Ford will join the Abraham Lincoln carrier , several guided-missile destroyers, fighter jets and surveillance aircraft that have been moved to the Middle East in recent weeks. The United States most recently had two aircraft carriers in the area last year, when it carried out strikes against Iranian nuclear sites in June. With only 11 aircraft carriers in the US military’s arsenal, they are a scarce resource and their schedules are usually set well in advance. In a statement, US Southern Command, which oversees US military operations in Latin America, said it would continue to stay focused on countering “illicit activities and malign actors in the Western Hemisphere”. Trump had said this week he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East if a deal is not reached with Iran. On Friday, he told reporters he thought that talks with Iran would be successful but warned that “if they’re not, it’s going to be a bad day for Iran”. Long deployment The Ford has essentially been at sea since June 2025. It was supposed to be operating in Europe before it was abruptly moved to the Caribbean in November. While deployments for carriers usually last nine months, it is not uncommon for them to be extended during periods of increased US military activity. Navy officials have long warned that long deployments at sea can damage morale on ships. Officials said the administration had looked at sending a separate carrier, the Bush, to the Middle East, but it was undergoing certification and would take over a month to reach the Middle East. The Ford, which has a nuclear reactor on board, can hold more than 75 military aircraft, including fighter aircraft like the F-18 Super Hornet jets and the E-2 Hawkeye, which can act as an early warning system. The Ford also includes sophisticated radar that can help control air traffic and navigation. The supporting ships, such as the Ticonderoga-class guided missile cruiser Normandy, Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyers Thomas Hudner, Ramage, Carney, and Roosevelt, include surface-to-air, surface-to-surface and anti-submarine warfare capabilities.",

      "summary_orig": "UNITED NATIONS: The 15-member United Nations Security Council (UNSC) on Friday condemned the suicide bombing at an imambargah in Islamabad in the “strongest terms”. On February 6, a suicide bomber had ripped through the Friday congregation at the Imambargah Qasr-i-Khadijatul Kubra on the outskirts of Islamabad. At least 38 people were killed in the incident and more than 150 were injured. In a press statement issued by UNSC President James Kariuki, the 15-member body described the February 6 attack as a “heinous and cowardly suicide bombing terrorist attack”. The UNSC expressed “its deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan” and wished “a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured”. Reaffirming its long-standing position, the UNSC said that “terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security”. The statement further stated that UNSC members stressed the need to ensure accountability, underlining “the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice”. They urged all states to cooperate actively with Pakistan “in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions”. Last week, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also strongly condemned the attack. “The secretary general reiterates that attacks against civilians and places of worship are unacceptable,” his spokesperson said, stressing that those responsible “must be identified and brought to justice”.",

She pulled out of the jury at the Berlin festival in protest at jury president Wim Wenders’ claim that films should “stay out of politics” ; she said Wenders’ stance was “unconscionable”, and that to “hear [him] say that art should not be political is jaw-dropping.” Wenders had suggested that cinema is a way to build empathy, but not directly change politicians’ minds. However this is simply not true. Some films – both documentary and narrative – have not only changed public opinion about social issues but led directly to legislation. Despite evidence to the contrary, politicians are people too. They can be moved. And sometimes they are even moved to action. Continue reading...",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s Ambassador to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Shafqat Ali Khan on Friday denied reports that the Gulf country has suspended the issuance of 96- and 48-hour transit visas for Pakistanis. “It’s not true,” he said in response to Dawn ’s query about reports circulating on social media. The 96- and 48-hour transit visas are sponsored by the UAE-based airlines — Emirates and Etihad Airways — and must be processed and approved before entering the UAE, according to the information available on the government’s website . “If you are not eligible for a visa on arrival or a visa-free entry to the UAE, and intend to step out of the airport, then you need a pre-arranged transit visa,” the website says. Several users shared screenshots on social media that stated: “As per the latest information from USE immigration transit visas (96 Hours and 48 Hours Visa) for PAKISTAN nationals has been temporarily suspended. Hence, kindly do not apply for this 96 Hours and 48 Hours visa category.” Others, meanwhile, just mentioned the reported suspension of the transit visas on X, citing a “notice”. Past visa issues Pakistanis have faced difficulties obtaining UAE visas over the past year. In January 2025, Overseas Employment Promoter Aisam Baig told the Senate Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis that some visas to the UAE had been “unofficially closed”. He said that the UAE had concerns about Pakistanis travelling on visit visas and resorting to begging. However, the committee’s chairman, Senator Zeeshan Khanzada, said there were “no restrictions on work visas” for Pakistanis travelling to the UAE. In April, UAE Ambassador Hamad Obaid Ibrahim Salem Al Zaabi said visa issues had been resolved and Pakistanis could avail a five-year visa. However, in early July, reports of visa rejections prompted Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to take up the matter with his UAE counterpart . In a meeting that month, UAE Interior Minister Sheikh Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan assured Naqvi of “full support” in expediting visas for Pakistani citizens, according to an official account of the talks. On November 27, 2025, Additional Interior Secretary Salman Chau­dhry told a Senate functional committee that the UAE was not issuing visas to Pakistanis. He had also said Saudi Arabia and the UAE had “stopped short of imposing a ban on the Pakistani passport”. But that same day, UAE Amba­ssador to Pakistan Salem M. Salem Al-Bawab Al-Zaabi shared what was described as “major UAE visa facilitation refo­rms for Pakistanis” with Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb, according to a statement issued by the finance ministry. The reforms discussed during their meeting in Islamabad included online visa processing, e-visas without passport stamping and faster system-to-system linkages, the finance ministry said. Last month, Pakistan and the UAE agreed to pursue a formal agreement on “pre-immigration clearance” for Pakistani nationals travelling to the Gulf country, the interior ministry said. Under the proposed arrangement, immigration formalities wo­u­ld be completed in Pakistan before departure, allowing passengers to avoid routine immigration processing on arrival in the UAE.",
