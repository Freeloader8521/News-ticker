      "title_orig": "Pakistan-Afghanistan tensions: FO says will ‘not shy away’ from any mediatory role by Iran",
      "summary_orig": "Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said on Sunday that Pakistan welcomed Iran’s offer of mediation between Islamabad and Kabul and would “not shy away from” it. “Iran is a brotherly, friendly country. Pakistan is always in favour of finding peaceful resolutions of issues through dialogue and diplomacy, and we appreciate the offer of mediation of our brotherly country, Iran,” Andrabi told Dawn upon a query about reports that Tehran was working to convene a regional meeting for mediation between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban. “We believe that Iran can play an important role. We would not shy away from any mediatory role by Iran. Mediations are always welcome,” Andrabi said, adding that Pakistan had a “very strong case”. He further stated: “Generally, mediations are resented by a country or a side which is on a weak legal or a political case. Pakistan’s case on this issue, on terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, is very strong. So, obviously we will not shy away from mediation.” Pakistan, which has been grappling with the problem of terrorism for long, has been demanding that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But, the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. Earlier this month, a third round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators from Turkiye and Qatar, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism. The talks had followed deadly border clashes between the two neighbours in October. The border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on the night of October 11 and continued into the next morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm or deny whether it was behind the strikes, but maintained that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on the evening of October 15, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. But on November 7, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “ over ” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban have suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia called for continued dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan to resolve their ongoing disputes on cross-border terrorism. Previously on Nov 9, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had spoken with his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul. According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi had also expressed Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries. The same day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer casualties among its security forces and civilian population in terror attacks, which authorities link to Afghanistan .",

Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer casualties among its security forces and civilian population in terror attacks, which authorities link to Afghanistan .",

      "summary": "Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Hussain Andrabi said on Sunday that Pakistan welcomed Iran’s offer of mediation between Islamabad and Kabul and would “not shy away from” it. “Iran is a brotherly, friendly country. Pakistan is always in favour of finding peaceful resolutions of issues through dialogue and diplomacy, and we appreciate the offer of mediation of our brotherly country, Iran,” Andrabi told Dawn upon a query about reports that Tehran was working to convene a regional meeting for mediation between Islamabad and the Afghan Taliban. “We believe that Iran can play an important role. We would not shy away from any mediatory role by Iran. Mediations are always welcome,” Andrabi said, adding that Pakistan had a “very strong case”. He further stated: “Generally, mediations are resented by a country or a side which is on a weak legal or a political case. Pakistan’s case on this issue, on terrorism emanating from Afghanistan, is very strong. So, obviously we will not shy away from mediation.” Pakistan, which has been grappling with the problem of terrorism for long, has been demanding that the rulers in Kabul take action to stop cross-border terrorism. But, the Afghan Taliban deny Islamabad’s allegation of terrorists being allowed to use Afghan soil to carry out attacks in Pakistan. Earlier this month, a third round of talks between Islamabad and Kabul, which were taking place in Istanbul in the presence of mediators from Turkiye and Qatar, broke down without any agreement, as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences over how to prevent cross-border terrorism. The talks had followed deadly border clashes between the two neighbours in October. The border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan started late on the night of October 11 and continued into the next morning. The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists were killed when Islamabad responded to aggression by Kabul. Afghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm or deny whether it was behind the strikes, but maintained that Kabul should “stop harbouring the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan on its soil”. After the initial skirmish on Oct 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan. A ceasefire was then agreed upon on the evening of October 15, and eventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha. After the Doha talks, a temporary ceasefire continued to prevent border hostilities while the two sides committed to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries. On October 25, the second round of talks between the two sides began in the Turkish capital. But, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar announced in a post on X on October 29 that the talks “failed to bring about any workable solution”. He also asserted that Pakistan would continue to take all possible measures to protect its citizens from terrorism. However, mediators Turkiye and Qatar intervened and managed to salvage the dialogue process with an October 31 joint statement released by Turkiye stating that “further modalities of the implementation will be discussed and decided” during a principal-level meeting in Istanbul on November 6. But on November 7, Defence Minister Khawaja said that talks addressing cross-border terrorism were “ over ” and “entered an indefinite phase” as negotiators failed to bridge deep differences between the two sides. Following the failure of the talks, the Afghan Taliban have suspended trade ties with Pakistan. Earlier this week, the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia called for continued dialogue between Pakistan and Afghanistan to resolve their ongoing disputes on cross-border terrorism. Previously on Nov 9, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said he had spoken with his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul. According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi had also expressed Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries. The same day, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, Defence Minister Yasar Guler and intelligence chief Ibrahim Kalin would visit Islamabad next week to discuss tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan continues to suffer casualties among its security forces and civilian population in terror attacks, which authorities link to Afghanistan .",

      "summary_orig": "Maaz Sadaqat’s blazing unbeaten 79 off 47 balls powered Pakistan Shaheens to a commanding eight-wicket victory over India ‘A’ in their Rising Stars Asia Cup Group ‘B’ clash on Saturday, chasing down 137 with 40 balls to spare. The 19-year-old all-rounder, who also claimed two wickets earlier, single-handedly dismantled India’s bowling after a dropped catch, ensuring Shaheens maintained their unbeaten run in the tournament. Electing to bowl first at Doha’s West End Park, Pakistan’s disciplined attack triggered a spectacular Indian collapse, bundling out the opposition for 136 in 19 overs after a promising start. Teenage sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi, 14, lit up the innings with a fiery 45 off 28 balls (five fours and three sixes), smashing boundaries at will against Ubaid Shah and Shahid Aziz. Partnering with Naman Dhir (35 off 20, six fours and a six), Suryavanshi added 49 for the second wicket, propelling India to 81-2 by the ninth over. But Sufiyan Muqeem’s left-arm wrist spin turned the tide, dismissing Suryavanshi caught at long-on in a contentious decision upheld after multiple replays. Captain Jitesh Sharma’s scratchy five precipitated a middle-order meltdown; India lost eight wickets for just 35 runs in the final 10 overs. Maaz (2-12) and Saad Masood (2-31) choked the scoring with clever variations, while Shahid (3-24) mopped up the tail with yorkers and slower balls. Harsh Dubey’s late 19 off 15 offered brief resistance, but India’s total — the tournament’s lowest a day after their 297 against UAE — proved inadequate. Shaheen’s chase began aggressively, Maaz and Mohammad Naeem (14 off 10) racing to 51-0 in five overs thanks to Gurjapneet Singh’s wayward spell (. Yash Thakur provided a breakthrough, with Dhir’s diving catch at mid-off, but Maaz exploded; a half-century off 31 balls included audacious sixes off Dhir’s off-spin and Suyash Sharma. Dropped on 56 by Suryavanshi at point, Maaz unleashed fury, sealing victory with Mohammad Faiq (16 not out off 14) via a pull for six in the 14th over. India’s fielding woes — missed chances and misfields — compounded bowling errors, as Pakistan’s required run rate dipped below four. Scores in brief: INDIA ‘A’ 136 in 19 overs (V. Suryavanshi 45, N. Dhir 35; Shahid Aziz 3-24, Saad Masood 2-31); PAKISTAN SHAHEENS 137-2 in 13.2 overs (Maaz Sadaqat 79 not out, Mohammad Faiq 16 not out)",

      "summary_orig": "The Jaffar Express, which has been targeted multiple times in the recent past, escaped a bomb attack in Balochistan’s Nasirabad district on Sunday, police and railway officials said. According to police officials, unidentified attackers had planted an explosive device on the railway track in the Shaheed Abdul Aziz Bullo area to target the Peshawar-bound train that was travelling from Quetta and later detonated it. However, the train passed the area safely, and no loss of life was reported, the officials said. Nasirabad Senior Superintendent of Police Ghulam Sarwar told Dawn that police and other security forces had reached the site soon after the blast, cordoned off the area and initiated an investigation. “A search operation has also been launched to trace the elements involved in the bomb attack,” he said. Separately, railway officials told Dawn a portion of the track was damaged due to the blast, as a result of which railway traffic between Quetta and the rest of the country was suspended. Meanwhile, the officials added that the Jaffar Express continued its journey to Peshawar after reaching Jacobabad in Sindh. The railway officials said Jaffar Express had resumed operations today after a suspension of four days. The train’s operations were suspended due to security concerns, they said. With a rise in terrorist attacks over the past few years, Balochistan has seen a series of incidents where militants blow up train tracks, targeting the province’s transport infrastructure. Jaffar Express has been attacked frequently since March 11, when  Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Consequently, the security forces initiated an operation that lasted two days. Inter-Services Public Relations Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said on March 12 that the Jaffar Express clearance operation launched a day after the train’s unprecedented hijacking, was complete. He added that all terrorists, 33 in total, at the site of the attack had been killed. On June 18, the detonation of a remote-controlled explosive device fitted to rail tracks derailed four bogies of the Jaffar Express near the cattle market in Jacobabad. No one was hurt in the incident, but the attack was reportedly claimed by the banned Baloch Repu­blican Guards in a statement. On August 7, the Quetta-bound Jaffar Express narrowly escaped disaster when a bomb planted near the track close to Sibi Railway Station exploded just after the passenger train passed. Later that week on August 10, no loss of life was reported after a bomb blast on a railway track in Balochistan’s Mastung district derailed six bogies of Jaffar Express. Muhammad Kashif, public relations officer of the Pakistan Railways’ Quetta division, told Dawn : “A bomb attached to the railway track exploded loudly, derailing six bogies of the train.“ On September 23, at least four people were injured as a blast derailed six bogies of Jaffar Express near Spezand town in the Dasht tehsil of Balochistan’s Mastung district. On October 7, at least seven people were injured after a blast on a railway track derailed four bogies of Jaf­far Express in Sindh’s Shikarpur district. Shikarpur Deputy Commissioner Shakeel Abro told Dawn , “A blast had occurred on the train tracks at 8:15am. The incident occurred at a distance of 1km from the Sultan Kot railway station.” Later that month, on October 29, the train service escaped a rocket attack in the Notal area of Nasir­abad district. “Armed men fired four rockets from a distance to target the passenger train,”  Nasira­bad SSP Ghulam Sarwar told Dawn , adding that none of the rockets hit the train.",

The National Investigation Agency (NIA), the country’s counter-terrorism body, said the attacker and the second suspect were both from India-occupied Kashmir, where police have carried out sweeping raids in recent days. Announcing “a breakthrough” in the investigation, the NIA said it had arrested Amir Rashid Ali, describing him as an accomplice of the “suicide bomber” under whose name “the car involved in the attack was registered”. He had come to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne Improvised Explosive Device (IED) to trigger the blast”, the counter-terrorism agency said in a statement . It identified the car’s driver as Umarun Nabi, a resident of occupied Kashmir who was an assistant professor in general medicine at a university in the northern state of Haryana. The explosion on Monday took place near a busy metro station close to the landmark Red Fort in the capital’s Old Delhi quarter, where the prime minister delivers the annual Independence Day address. A hospital official said the blast killed 12 people . It was unclear whether Nabi was included in the toll. The NIA’s statement said the attack “claimed 10 innocent lives and left 32 others injured”. The NIA claimed it had seized another vehicle belonging to Nabi.

The ISPR statement said that during his visit to GIDS, the Jordanian king was given a comprehensive briefing on the structure, capabilities, and product portfolio of the conglomerate. “The briefing showcased Pakistan’s progress in indigenous defence production, technological innovation, and potential avenues for bilateral defence cooperation between Pakistan and Jordan,” the statement added. Later, it said, King Abdullah visited Tilla Field Firing Ranges, where he was joined by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. “Vugar Valeh oglu Mustafayev, minister of defence industry of the Republic of Azerbaijan, was also amongst the distinguished guests at the firing ranges.” At the firing ranges, the “distinguished guests witnessed a joint fire and manoeuvre exercise”, the ISPR statement said, adding that the “exercise demonstrated multi-domain operations, including conventional and air firepower, coordinated manoeuvres, spectrum warfare capabilities supported by multi-purpose drones employed in various configurations and roles”.

Earlier, the ISPR statement said, King Abdullah conferred upon the COAS the Order of the Military Merit of First Degree, “in recognition of his outstanding service and significant contributions to strengthening military cooperation between the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and Pakistan”.

By virtue of his personal engagement, the bilateral relations between Pakistan and Jordan have been significantly strengthened across diverse fields encompassing political and economic cooperation, defence collaboration, educational partnerships, cultural exchanges and people-to-people contacts.” It continued: “These developments serve to reinforce the enduring foundation of the historic friendship and brotherhood between the two nations, while concurrently fostering new avenues of cooperation. “The people and government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan deeply value His Majesty King Abdullah II’s … commitment to strengthening bilateral relations and consistent solidarity with Pakistan. “In recognition of his remarkable statesmanship and enduring contributions for further cementing Pakistan-Jordan relations, coupled with promotion of regional and international peace, the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan has been pleased to confer … the award of Nishan-i-Pakistan as a symbol of profound respect, admiration and friendship from the people and Government of Pakistan.” The prime minister and Jordanian king also held a bilateral meeting on Saturday at the PM House after the latter arrived in Pakistan. During the meeting, both leaders affirmed “zero-tolerance” for any displacement of Palestinians from the besieged Gaza Strip in the aftermath of the devastating military onslaught by Israel in the territory. King Abdullah II also praised Pakistan’s consistent support for Jordan’s role in regional stability and humanitarian efforts during the Gaza conflict, as well as for the territory after the ceasefire.

      "summary_orig": "Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir has said that “Pakistan will respond to those who impose war on it in the same way as it did in May” this year during the brief, but intense, conflict with India, Daily Jang reported on Sunday. The army chief made these comments to the Urdu newspaper during a luncheon held in honour of King Abdullah II of Jordan, who arrived in Islamabad yesterday for a two-day visit. “During the war with India, Allah helped us raise our heads high,” Field Marshal Munir said. “When a Muslim puts their trust in Allah, He turns the dirt thrown at the enemy into missiles.” The COAS added that he performs his duties according to the command of Allah and said it was by God’s grace that Pakistan defeated its enemy. “This army is an army of Allah and our soldiers fight in His name,” the field marshal added. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated sharply in early May 2025 after an attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam prompted New Delhi to launch “Operation Sindoor” on May 7, targeting sites inside Pakistan and causing civilian casualties. India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched the retaliatory ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire. Addressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul last month, Field Marshal Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.” Calling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.“",

The army chief made these comments to the Urdu newspaper during a luncheon held in honour of King Abdullah II of Jordan, who arrived in Islamabad yesterday for a two-day visit. “During the war with India, Allah helped us raise our heads high,” Field Marshal Munir said. “When a Muslim puts their trust in Allah, He turns the dirt thrown at the enemy into missiles.” The COAS added that he performs his duties according to the command of Allah and said it was by God’s grace that Pakistan defeated its enemy. “This army is an army of Allah and our soldiers fight in His name,” the field marshal added.

      "summary_orig": "More than 100 people were injured and 20 arrested during a massive protest on Saturday in Mexico City against the president’s handling of violent crime, local government officials said. Thousands marched on the capital’s historic main public square, the Zocalo, in a demonstration fueled by young Mexicans with ties to a global wave of Generation Z protests as well as supporters of the domestic “Sombrero Movement,” which emerged after the recent assassination of a mayor known for his fight against organised crime. View this post on Instagram AFP observed participants of all ages taking part in the rally in front of the National Palace, where President Claudia Sheinbaum lives and works. Several protesters, some wearing balaclavas, toppled the metal barriers protecting the palace and threw paving stones at riot police, who responded with tear gas, according to AFP journalists. “For many hours, this mobilisation proceeded and developed peacefully, until a group of hooded individuals began to commit acts of violence,” Pablo Vazquez, Mexico City’s security chief, told reporters. Twenty protesters and 100 police were injured, with 40 officers hospitalised for cuts and bruises, he added. Police arrested 20 people for theft and assault, Vazquez said, and had also launched an investigation into the assault of a journalist from La Jornada newspaper, who alleged that police officers were behind the incident. Inspired by murdered mayor Sheinbaum, in power since October 2024, maintained approval ratings above 70 per cent in her first year in office but faced growing criticism of her security policies in the wake of several high-profile murders. “This is one of the most corrupt governments we’ve ever had,” said Valentina Ramirez, a student interviewed by AFP . “It’s a corrupt narco-government that wants to defend the corrupt and the cartels instead of the people.” On Saturday, several protesters wore sombreros similar to the style of hat made famous by Carlos Manzo, a mayor in western Michoacan state who was assassinated on November 1. He had been known for his crusade against drug-trafficking gangs in his hometown Uruapan. The assassinated mayor’s widow, however, distanced her husband’s movement from the demonstration on Saturday. Bernardo Bravo, a leader of lime producers in the same region, had also been shot dead in late October. Earlier this week, Sheinbaum questioned the motivations for the demonstration and said at her regular morning news conference that the protest was “inorganic” and “paid for”. “It is a movement promoted from abroad against the government,” she said. Demonstrators displayed banners bearing messages such as “We are all Carlos Manzo” alongside the iconic pirate flag from the Japanese manga One Piece, which has become a symbol of youth protest around the world, from Madagascar to the Philippines and Peru. “You should have protected Carlos Manzo like this!” some protesters shouted at security forces, who responded with fire extinguishers and tear gas.",

      "summary_orig": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: Gomal University has expelled several students after a series of serious campus unrest incidents, according to an official handout issued by the varsity administration. The statement said that on various dates in October, students along with external accomplices stormed the registrar’s office, assaulted a female student, attempted to forcefully enter the vice-chancellor’s office, attacked a police guard, and showed deliberate disrespect during the national anthem at an event. Another reported incident involved anti-Pakistan slogans during a cricket match screening. A fact-finding committee was formed to investigate the incidents, after which the case was referred to the university’s disciplinary committee. The accused students were issued show-cause notices and given the opportunity to present their defence. Their replies were found unsatisfactory. Under university discipline rules, the administration expelled the involved students and cancelled their admissions. Hostel rooms were vacated and sealed. Those expelled include Aman Burki, Irfanullah, Nangyal Bittani, Ehsan Mehsud, and Tariq Bittani, while former student Amir Bittani has been banned from campus for five years. The university clarified that expelled students cannot seek admission in any other institution. The administration stated that a small group, backed by disruptive elements, has been attempting to disturb the university’s peaceful environment. It added that despite recent improvements in academics and administration under Vice-Chancellor Dr Zafar Iqbal, certain groups tried to incite unrest through false propaganda. The university has also sought support from district authorities and the police to maintain security on the campus. Published in Dawn, November 16th, 2025",
