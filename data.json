On Dec. 29 last year, the Jeju Air jet from Bangkok erupted into flames after crashing into a concrete mound as it overshot the runway when it made an emergency belly landing at Muan International Airport, South Jeolla Province, following a bird strike. The 18-member committee, which will run for at least 40 days, plans to look closely into factors that may have been blamed for the crash, including the bird strike, the mound the jet crashed into and possible aircraft defects. It will also investigate whether any cover-up attempts were made in the government's investigation into the crash. The committee's launch comes after the government shelved a plan to announce the interim results of its investigation earlier this month. Family members of the tragedy's victims have voiced opposition against the government investigation, raising questions about its transparency and credibility and calling for an independent probe.",

      "summary_orig": "A car bomb killed a senior Russian general in southern Moscow on Monday morning, the latest high-profile army figure to be blown up in a blast that came just hours after Russian and Ukrainian delegates held separate talks in Miami on a plan to end the war. Kyiv has not commented on the incident, but Russian investigators said they were probing whether the blast was “linked” to “Ukrainian special forces”. The attack was similar to other assassinations of generals and pro-war figures that have either been claimed, or are widely believed to have been orchestrated, by Ukraine. Lieutenant General Fanil Sarvarov, 56, head of the Russian General Staff’s training department, was killed when the bomb, which had been placed under his parked car, detonated in a residential quarter of southern Moscow. AFP reporters at the scene saw a mangled white Kia SUV, its doors and back window blown out. The frame was twisted and charred from the blast. The scene had been cordoned off by security forces, and investigators were sifting through the debris. Eyewitnesses reported a loud bang. “We absolutely didn’t expect it. We thought we were safe, and then this happens right next to us,” local resident, Tatiana, 74, told AFP . “The windows rattled, you could tell it was an explosion,” said Grigory, 70, who also declined to give his surname. “We need to treat it more calmly. It’s the cost of war,” he added. Russia’s Investigative Committee, which probes major crimes, said it was “working through various lines of enquiry into the murder. One of them involves the possible organisation of the crime by Ukrainian special services“. Sarvarov fought in the Russian army’s campaigns in the North Caucasus, including Chechnya in the 1990s, according to his official biography on the defence ministry’s website . He also commanded Russian forces in Syria in 2015-16. Talks intensify The Kremlin said Putin had been informed about Monday’s killing, which came after three days of talks in Miami as the United States intensifies its efforts to broker an end to the four-year war. Ukrainian negotiator Rustem Umerov and US special envoy Steve Witkoff hailed “progress” in the negotiations on Sunday. Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev also met with the US team, which included Jared Kushner, US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law. Witkoff had also called those meetings “productive and constructive.” An initial 28-point plan to end the war put forward by Trump adhered to Moscow’s core demands, triggering panic in Kyiv and European capitals. Ukraine and its allies have since been working to refine the plan, though Kyiv says it is still being asked to make massive concessions, such as giving up the entire eastern Donbas region to Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has expressed scepticism over whether Russia really wants to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands and decimated eastern and southern Ukraine. The Kremlin on Monday also denied that it wanted to recreate the Soviet Union, seize the whole of Ukraine and more land in eastern Europe after Reuters reported that US intelligence had concluded Putin seeks much more than just control over eastern Ukraine. Since Moscow sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022, Kyiv has been blamed for several attacks targeting Russian military officials and pro-Kremlin personalities in Russia and in Russian-controlled Ukrainian regions. General Yaroslav Moskalik, a deputy of the General Staff, was killed in a car blast near Moscow in April. In December 2024, Igor Kirillov, the head of the Russian radiological, chemical and biological defence forces, was killed when a booby-trapped electric scooter exploded in Moscow, an attack claimed by Ukraine’s SBU security service. A Russian military blogger, Maxim Fomin, was killed when a statuette exploded in a Saint Petersburg café in April 2023. And in August 2022, a car bomb killed Daria Dugina, the daughter of ultranationalist ideologue Alexander Dugin.",

      "summary_en": "A car bomb killed a senior Russian general in southern Moscow on Monday morning, the latest high-profile army figure to be blown up in a blast that came just hours after Russian and Ukrainian delegates held separate talks in Miami on a plan to end the war. Kyiv has not commented on the incident, but Russian investigators said they were probing whether the blast was “linked” to “Ukrainian special forces”. The attack was similar to other assassinations of generals and pro-war figures that have either been claimed, or are widely believed to have been orchestrated, by Ukraine.

      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh has rejected India’s dismissal of a protest outside its high commission in New Delhi as “misleading propaganda”, saying the incident was “highly regrettable“. According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, Prothom Alo reported.* In response, the Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal issued a statement on Sunday saying India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”. “The fact is that about 20-25 youth gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on December 20 and raised slogans in protest against the horrendous killing of Dipu Chandra Das in Mymensingh, while also calling for the protection of all minorities in Bangladesh,” he said. According to Prothom Alo, Das — a garment factory worker — was beaten to death on December 18 in Mymensingh, Bangladesh on allegations of blasphemy, after which his body was set on fire. It reported that 10 people had been arrested in connection with the incident. “There was no attempt to breach the fence or create a security situation at any time. The police stationed at the spot dispersed the group after a few minutes,” the Indian official said. “Visual evidence of these events is available publicly for all to see. India is committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions/posts in its territory in accordance with the Vienna Convention,” he added. “India continues to keep a close watch on the evolving situation in Bangladesh. Our officials remain in touch with Bangladesh authorities and have conveyed to them our strong concerns at the attacks on minorities. We have also urged that the perpetrators of the barbaric killing of Das be brought to justice,” he said. In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”. “The miscreants were allowed to carry out their activities right outside the perimeters of the high commission, creating panic among the personnel inside the complex,” it said, adding that the commission was not made aware of the event beforehand. The statement, however, took note of the Indian government’s “commitment” towards the safety of Bangladeshi diplomatic posts in India. Bangladesh also rejected “an attempt of the Indian authorities to depict an isolated attack on a Bangladeshi citizen, who happens to belong to the Hindu community, as attacks on minorities“. The statement said that the government “promptly apprehended the suspects in this incident“. It noted that “the intercommunal situation in Bangladesh is better than in many other parts in South Asia”. “Bangladesh believes that it is the duty of all governments in the region to ensure protection of minorities in their respective countries,” the statement added. Ties between the two countries have been frosty since former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled to India following a student-led uprising last year. Dhaka has repeatedly asked for her extradition so that she could stand trial for her alleged crimes, with Delhi responding that it was examining the requests. On Thursday, protesters, seeking the repatriation of Hasina, were stopped from marching towards an Indian diplomatic mission. A day earlier, India’s foreign ministry had conveyed its concerns over the “deteriorating” security environment in the country, following protests triggered by the killing of a prominent youth leader.",

      "summary_orig": "Multan’s Nishtar Hospital has sacked a doctor working as an additional house officer for misbehaving with a patient’s family, a video of which had gone viral on social media, it emerged on Monday. In the video, the family members could be heard saying that the patient had passed away after doctors refused to give her a blood transfusion. When the video panned to the doctor in question, he raised his arm, showing his middle finger and walking away. A large crowd could also be seen in the video. The doctor, identified as Qasim Jamal, was suspended from duty on Dec 19, a day after the incident occurred. Meanwhile, an inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident. Subsequently, the hospital issued a notification the same day stating that the doctor had been terminated with immediate effect for misconduct, and violating hospital rules and professional ethics. In the incident report dated Dec 20, the director of the Accident and Emergency Department said that the patient was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition on Thursday. It said she was in the process of being stabilised after being treated at the department and was to be transferred to a different ward for blood transfusions. However, the patient’s condition deteriorated to a point where transfusions were no longer feasible, leading to agitation among her attendants, it said. “Attendants misbehaved with [the] doctor as well as staff on duty,” the report said. “After that, [the] doctor also misbehaved and [showed an] inappropriate gesture to the attendants,“ it said. It added that treatment was given to the patient “properly and accordingly”. Meanwhile, the doctor in question also issued a detailed statement on Dec 20 in response to the incident, saying that his reaction was merely a “symbol of protest” against what he called continuous attacks and harassment by the patient’s family. Regarding the treatment of the patient, he said that her condition had been “very critical and active treatment was ongoing” but her condition deteriorated. He said that they attempted to resuscitate her but she was later declared dead. He said that the patient’s attendants then started misbehaving with doctors and staff, creating chaos in the emergency room. He added that there was “complete negligence on the part of the security staff, who allowed over twelve men with mobile cameras to enter the restricted area of ​​the emergency room”. He said that while he and the other staff were treating over a dozen other patients, the attendants continued to “shout, abuse, threaten and harass” him, including getting physically violent. “After repeated humiliation, verbal abuse, physical threats and four consecutive attempted attacks, it was impossible for any human being to remain unaffected,” the doctor said. “My reaction was the result of continued provocation, not an unprovoked act. I state clearly that I did not abuse, misbehave or physically attack anyone. I did not utter a single word of profanity. My response was calm and disciplined,” he said. “I admit that I was under severe mental stress and anger at that time. Protesting is a fundamental right of every individual and employee, and I exercised this right peacefully and non-violently,” he said. He added that the hospital rules did not clearly refer to silent gestures as violations of the law, saying, “If I had used abusive language or physical assault, it would certainly have been a violation of medical ethics, but that was not the case.” The doctor said that suspension without investigation was unfair and requested that he be reinstated in order to complete his training.",

      "summary_en": "Multan’s Nishtar Hospital has sacked a doctor working as an additional house officer for misbehaving with a patient’s family, a video of which had gone viral on social media, it emerged on Monday. In the video, the family members could be heard saying that the patient had passed away after doctors refused to give her a blood transfusion. When the video panned to the doctor in question, he raised his arm, showing his middle finger and walking away. A large crowd could also be seen in the video. The doctor, identified as Qasim Jamal, was suspended from duty on Dec 19, a day after the incident occurred. Meanwhile, an inquiry committee was also formed to probe the incident. Subsequently, the hospital issued a notification the same day stating that the doctor had been terminated with immediate effect for misconduct, and violating hospital rules and professional ethics. In the incident report dated Dec 20, the director of the Accident and Emergency Department said that the patient was admitted to the hospital in a critical condition on Thursday. It said she was in the process of being stabilised after being treated at the department and was to be transferred to a different ward for blood transfusions. However, the patient’s condition deteriorated to a point where transfusions were no longer feasible, leading to agitation among her attendants, it said. “Attendants misbehaved with [the] doctor as well as staff on duty,” the report said. “After that, [the] doctor also misbehaved and [showed an] inappropriate gesture to the attendants,“ it said. It added that treatment was given to the patient “properly and accordingly”. Meanwhile, the doctor in question also issued a detailed statement on Dec 20 in response to the incident, saying that his reaction was merely a “symbol of protest” against what he called continuous attacks and harassment by the patient’s family. Regarding the treatment of the patient, he said that her condition had been “very critical and active treatment was ongoing” but her condition deteriorated. He said that they attempted to resuscitate her but she was later declared dead. He said that the patient’s attendants then started misbehaving with doctors and staff, creating chaos in the emergency room. He added that there was “complete negligence on the part of the security staff, who allowed over twelve men with mobile cameras to enter the restricted area of ​​the emergency room”.

      "title_orig": "Recovering history",
      "summary_orig": "OVER the past two decades, the study of Pakistan’s post-independence history has grown considerably richer. As previously hidden or uncovered information sources and archives become available, and as intellectual tools to make sense of discrete events evolve, our understanding of the past grows both sharper and more complex. Within this growing repository of work, there are broadly two strands of scholarship. The first uses archives, cultural forms, and memory to reconstruct mainstream narratives of state-building, political and social change, and popular agency. This type of work is usually helpful in making sense of how the present came to be and in pushing back against homogenisation or linearity in the narration of the past. The second type of work is the uncovering of historical occurrence: events, trends, and happenings that have never been recorded because of historical amnesia and indifference or purposeful suppression. While this distinction is never neat, it is this second type that is on vivid display in historian Ilyas Chattha’s recently released book, Citizens to Traitors: Bengali Internment in Pakistan 1971-1974 . An outcome of a historian tugging at the thread of a chance, childhood encounter in central Punjab, Chattha’s work documents how ethnic Bengalis in (West) Pakistan were subjected to confinement for periods of up to three years in the aftermath of Bangladesh’s independence. As the title of the book suggests, this action was driven by heightened, paranoiac suspicion around the loyalty of ethnic Bengalis, given the ethnonationalist currents of the secessionist movement and a central state reeling from significant losses. Chattha documents that approximately 400,000 Bengalis were living in West Pakistan at the time of Bangladesh’s independence. While not all were detained, they were subjected to intense scrutiny under the Defence of Pakistan Rules, and reportedly more than 81,000 Bengalis, including military personnel, civil servants, and their families, were formally interned. This mass detention was hardly incidental, given how it formed part of a political strategy in the aftermath of the 1971 civil war. With 93,000 Pakistani POWs held in India, the state used Bengali internees as leverage in a triangular negotiation involving Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Chattha’s book provides careful documentation of the differentiated nature of internment. Military officers and senior civil servants, he writes, were confined in cantonment camps, while civilians, such as factory and service-sector workers suddenly dismissed from their jobs, were placed in overcrowded, unsanitary camps. By drawing on previously unseen personal correspondence and memory testimonies, the book details abject conditions and psychological trauma experienced by detainees now recast as ‘traitors’ in a country they had once served. Ilyas Chattha’s new book shows how formal ideals of citizenship run afoul of political exigencies and nationalist ideologies in modern states. Escape attempts form another critical historical layer of the book. Chattha records perilous journeys by land, sea, and air, often involving bribery, extortion, or death. High-profile escapes, such as those of singer Shahnaz Rahmatullah and Pakistan’s former Foreign Office official S.M. Yusuf, reflected the level of scrutiny and allowed for the mobilisation of international pressure. In fact, that last bit remains instrumental in how this episode was recovered from the margins of history. Families and well-wishers of those interned, residing abroad or in the newly independent state of Bangladesh, launched a global campaign to shed light on the situation, often taking out large adverts in international newspapers and magazines. That record was meticulously collected in the process of putting together this history. The deadlock ended only with the Tripartite Agreement of August 1973, enabling repatriation. By mid-1974, nearly 120,000 Bengalis had returned to Bangladesh. Yet their ordeal continued there: many were dismissed from service, stigmatised as collaborators, and marginalised within the new nation. It is this aspect that makes this new book not just about repression by the state, but also more broadly about how formal ideals of citizenship run afoul of political exigencies and nationalist ideologies in modern states. The Pakistani state cast one blanket of suspicion based on ethnic affiliation that led to the internment; and upon their repatriation, the Bangladeshi state cast another based on their geographic and occupational pasts. In both instances, though more in the former than the latter, standards of exception imposed by the sovereign (and supported by segments of society) created new forms of marginalisation and exclusion. While documentation for posterity’s sake is important, this new book also raises a more fundamental question: what is the point of retelling suppressed stories? There are two justifications that one can lean on in response. Firstly, state practices are never discrete occurrences. They carry histories and they possess futures. The practice of casting suspicion on a population and using that as an excuse to practise some form of collective punishment has a long history that stretches back into the colonial regime (from which our states directly derive). It was relived during the 1971 civil war, and is reflected even today in the existence of enforced disappearances and racialised regulations. Perhaps by documenting past trauma, society can be equipped to resist its repetition in the future. Secondly, there are social remnants of this particular past that still linger in Pakistan.

      "summary_en": "OVER the past two decades, the study of Pakistan’s post-independence history has grown considerably richer. As previously hidden or uncovered information sources and archives become available, and as intellectual tools to make sense of discrete events evolve, our understanding of the past grows both sharper and more complex. Within this growing repository of work, there are broadly two strands of scholarship. The first uses archives, cultural forms, and memory to reconstruct mainstream narratives of state-building, political and social change, and popular agency. This type of work is usually helpful in making sense of how the present came to be and in pushing back against homogenisation or linearity in the narration of the past. The second type of work is the uncovering of historical occurrence: events, trends, and happenings that have never been recorded because of historical amnesia and indifference or purposeful suppression. While this distinction is never neat, it is this second type that is on vivid display in historian Ilyas Chattha’s recently released book, Citizens to Traitors: Bengali Internment in Pakistan 1971-1974 . An outcome of a historian tugging at the thread of a chance, childhood encounter in central Punjab, Chattha’s work documents how ethnic Bengalis in (West) Pakistan were subjected to confinement for periods of up to three years in the aftermath of Bangladesh’s independence. As the title of the book suggests, this action was driven by heightened, paranoiac suspicion around the loyalty of ethnic Bengalis, given the ethnonationalist currents of the secessionist movement and a central state reeling from significant losses. Chattha documents that approximately 400,000 Bengalis were living in West Pakistan at the time of Bangladesh’s independence. While not all were detained, they were subjected to intense scrutiny under the Defence of Pakistan Rules, and reportedly more than 81,000 Bengalis, including military personnel, civil servants, and their families, were formally interned. This mass detention was hardly incidental, given how it formed part of a political strategy in the aftermath of the 1971 civil war. With 93,000 Pakistani POWs held in India, the state used Bengali internees as leverage in a triangular negotiation involving Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. Chattha’s book provides careful documentation of the differentiated nature of internment. Military officers and senior civil servants, he writes, were confined in cantonment camps, while civilians, such as factory and service-sector workers suddenly dismissed from their jobs, were placed in overcrowded, unsanitary camps. By drawing on previously unseen personal correspondence and memory testimonies, the book details abject conditions and psychological trauma experienced by detainees now recast as ‘traitors’ in a country they had once served. Ilyas Chattha’s new book shows how formal ideals of citizenship run afoul of political exigencies and nationalist ideologies in modern states. Escape attempts form another critical historical layer of the book. Chattha records perilous journeys by land, sea, and air, often involving bribery, extortion, or death. High-profile escapes, such as those of singer Shahnaz Rahmatullah and Pakistan’s former Foreign Office official S.M. Yusuf, reflected the level of scrutiny and allowed for the mobilisation of international pressure. In fact, that last bit remains instrumental in how this episode was recovered from the margins of history. Families and well-wishers of those interned, residing abroad or in the newly independent state of Bangladesh, launched a global campaign to shed light on the situation, often taking out large adverts in international newspapers and magazines. That record was meticulously collected in the process of putting together this history. The deadlock ended only with the Tripartite Agreement of August 1973, enabling repatriation. By mid-1974, nearly 120,000 Bengalis had returned to Bangladesh. Yet their ordeal continued there: many were dismissed from service, stigmatised as collaborators, and marginalised within the new nation. It is this aspect that makes this new book not just about repression by the state, but also more broadly about how formal ideals of citizenship run afoul of political exigencies and nationalist ideologies in modern states. The Pakistani state cast one blanket of suspicion based on ethnic affiliation that led to the internment; and upon their repatriation, the Bangladeshi state cast another based on their geographic and occupational pasts. In both instances, though more in the former than the latter, standards of exception imposed by the sovereign (and supported by segments of society) created new forms of marginalisation and exclusion. While documentation for posterity’s sake is important, this new book also raises a more fundamental question: what is the point of retelling suppressed stories? There are two justifications that one can lean on in response. Firstly, state practices are never discrete occurrences. They carry histories and they possess futures. The practice of casting suspicion on a population and using that as an excuse to practise some form of collective punishment has a long history that stretches back into the colonial regime (from which our states directly derive). It was relived during the 1971 civil war, and is reflected even today in the existence of enforced disappearances and racialised regulations. Perhaps by documenting past trauma, society can be equipped to resist its repetition in the future. Secondly, there are social remnants of this particular past that still linger in Pakistan.

      "summary_orig": "JERUSALEM: Israel’s security cabinet approved the establishment of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, a move the country’s far-right finance minister said on Sunday was aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state. The latest approvals come days after the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank — all of which are illegal under the international law — had reached its highest level since at least 2017. The Israeli government’s decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69, according to a statement from the office of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. “The proposal by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare and formalise 19 new settlements in Judea and Samaria has been approved by the cabinet,” the statement said, without specifying when the decision was taken. Decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69 Smotrich is a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself. “On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” he said in the statement. “We will continue to develop, build, and settle the land of our ancestral heritage, with faith in the justice of our path,” he said. UN chief condemns move UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Israel’s “relentless” expansion of settlements in the occupied territory. It “continues to fuel tensions, impede access by Palestinians to their land and threaten the viability of a fully independent, democratic, contiguous and sovereign Palestinian State”, he said earlier this month. Since the start of the war in Gaza, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have proliferated, with several European countries, Canada and Australia recently moving to formally recognise such a state, drawing rebukes from Israel. Sharp increase in settlements A UN report said the expansion of settlements was at its highest point since 2017, when the United Nations began tracking such data. “These figures represent a sharp increase compared to previous years,” Guterres said, noting an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022. “These developments are further entrenching the unlawful Israeli occupation and violating international law and undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,” the UN chief said. Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents. Smotrich’s office said the 19 newly appro­ved settlements are located in what it descr­ibed as “highly strategic” areas, adding that two of them — Ganim and Kadim in the nort­h­ern West Bank — would be re-established after being dismantled two decades ago. Five of the 19 settlements already existed but had not previously been granted legal status under Israeli law, the statement said. While all Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory are considered illegal under international law, some wildcat outposts are also illegal in the eyes of the Israeli government. Many of these, however, are later legalised by Israeli authorities, fuelling fears about the possible annexation of the territory. US President Donald Trump has warned Israel about annexing the occupied West Bank. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,” Trump said in a recent interview to Time magazine. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and violence there has soared since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023. Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 1,027 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank alone since the start of the fighting in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures. At least 44 Israelis have been killed in the occupied West Bank in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations during the same period, according to Israeli data.

Since the start of the war in Gaza, calls for the establishment of a Palestinian state have proliferated, with several European countries, Canada and Australia recently moving to formally recognise such a state, drawing rebukes from Israel. Sharp increase in settlements A UN report said the expansion of settlements was at its highest point since 2017, when the United Nations began tracking such data. “These figures represent a sharp increase compared to previous years,” Guterres said, noting an average of 12,815 housing units were added annually between 2017 and 2022. “These developments are further entrenching the unlawful Israeli occupation and violating international law and undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination,” the UN chief said. Excluding east Jerusalem, which was occupied and annexed by Israel in 1967, more than 500,000 Israelis live in the occupied West Bank, along with about three million Palestinian residents. Smotrich’s office said the 19 newly appro­ved settlements are located in what it descr­ibed as “highly strategic” areas, adding that two of them — Ganim and Kadim in the nort­h­ern West Bank — would be re-established after being dismantled two decades ago. Five of the 19 settlements already existed but had not previously been granted legal status under Israeli law, the statement said. While all Israeli settlements in the Palestinian territory are considered illegal under international law, some wildcat outposts are also illegal in the eyes of the Israeli government. Many of these, however, are later legalised by Israeli authorities, fuelling fears about the possible annexation of the territory. US President Donald Trump has warned Israel about annexing the occupied West Bank. “Israel would lose all of its support from the United States if that happened,” Trump said in a recent interview to Time magazine. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967, and violence there has soared since the Gaza war erupted in October 2023. Israeli troops or settlers have killed at least 1,027 Palestinians in the occupied West Bank alone since the start of the fighting in Gaza, according to an AFP tally based on Palestinian health ministry figures. At least 44 Israelis have been killed in the occupied West Bank in Palestinian attacks or Israeli military operations during the same period, according to Israeli data.

      "summary": "JERUSALEM: Israel’s security cabinet approved the establishment of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank, a move the country’s far-right finance minister said on Sunday was aimed at preventing the establishment of a Palestinian state. The latest approvals come days after the United Nations said the expansion of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank — all of which are illegal under the international law — had reached its highest level since at least 2017. The Israeli government’s decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69, according to a statement from the office of Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich. “The proposal by Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz to declare and formalise 19 new settlements in Judea and Samaria has been approved by the cabinet,” the statement said, without specifying when the decision was taken. Decision brings the total number of settlements illegally approved over the past three years to 69 Smotrich is a vocal proponent of settlement expansion and a settler himself. “On the ground, we are blocking the establishment of a Palestinian terror state,” he said in the statement. “We will continue to develop, build, and settle the land of our ancestral heritage, with faith in the justice of our path,” he said.

      "summary_orig": "United States Senator Lindsey Graham called on Sunday for renewed military action against Hamas and Hezbollah if they fail to disarm and accused the Palestinian group of consolidating its power in Gaza. The Republican politician, on a visit to Israel, is a staunch ally of US President Donald Trump. Beginning in October, a fragile ceasefire has so far halted two years of war between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip despite both sides trading accusations of truce violations. A separate ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah also came into effect in November 2024 after more than a year of hostilities, though Israel continues to carry out strikes on Lebanese territory. Israel has made dismantling the arsenals of both groups, allies of its arch-foe Iran, a key condition for any lasting peace. “It’s imperative we come up with a plan quickly, put Hamas on a time clock, give them a period of time to achieve the goal of disarmament,” Graham said at a press conference during his visit. “And if you don’t, I would encourage President Trump to unleash Israel to go finish off Hamas. “It’s a long, brutal war, but you cannot be successful anywhere in the region until you deliver on dealing Hamas out of the future of Gaza and disarming them,” Graham added, insisting that the second stage of the truce would fail if Hamas remains armed. “Ninety days after the ceasefire, they are consolidating power in Gaza.“ Graham also called for military engagement against Hezbollah if it too does not surrender its weapons. “If Hezbollah refuses to give up their heavy weapons, down the road we should engage in military operations working with Lebanon, Israel and the United States, where we fly with Israel … to take Hezbollah out,” Graham said. Opposition to Turkiye The Lebanese government has begun to disarm Hezbollah, starting in the country’s south, and insists it will complete the plan. Israel, however, has questioned the effectiveness of the Lebanese military, while Hezbollah itself has repeatedly refused to lay down its weapons. Graham’s remarks came a day after mediators the US, Qatar, Egypt and Turkiye urged both sides in the war on Gaza to uphold the ceasefire. The mediators are pressing for the implementation of the second phase of the truce, which would involve an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, the deployment of an international stabilisation force and the establishment of an interim authority to govern the territory in place of Hamas. The second phase of the Gaza truce also envisages the demilitarisation of the territory, including the disarmament of Hamas. Graham backed Israel’s opposition to Turkiye being included in the stabilisation force , saying it would “rock Israel to its core”. “There is no political support anywhere in Israel for having Turkiye being involved in the stabilising force,” he said. Hamas, meanwhile, has called on the mediators and Washington to stop Israeli violations of the ceasefire in Gaza. On Sunday, Israeli artillery shelling was reported in several parts of Gaza’s southern area of Khan Yunis, according to the civil defence agency, which operates under the authority of Hamas. On Friday, six people, including two children, were killed in an Israeli bombing of a school serving as a shelter for displaced people, according to the agency.",

      "summary_orig": "ISLAMABAD: As Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi announced preparations for a countrywide movement and that a call will soon be given, the main opposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) on Sunday announced a nationwide wheel-jam and shutter-down strike on February 8, 2026. The date coincides with the second anniversary of the 2024 general elections , in which the current PML-N government rose to power. Claiming that the country needed a new Charter of Democracy more than ever before, the TTAP also decided to form a committee headed by Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, with Haleem Adil Sheikh, Zain Shah and others to constitute committees at the provincial and district level. The TTAP announced that it will also organise conferences at all provincial headquarters and engage bar councils, civil society and the public for efforts for the restoration of the Constitution, rule of law and democracy in Pakistan. Those who attended today’s conference included TTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, PTI leaders Asad Qaiser and Salman Akram Raja, Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Akhtar Mengal and others. CM Afridi, who also attended the conference, told media persons that, as per the directions of incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan, the preparations for the countrywide movement have been started. “We will meet every person and will tell them to wait for the second call. We will go to Rawalpindi, Lahore, KP and other parts of the country,” he said while replying to questions. According to the declaration from the conference, as democracy was not possible without free and fair elections, an effort would be made to ensure free and fair elections. Participants demanded the immediate appointment of a neutral chief election commissioner and next elections be held under a reconstituted Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). They also demanded an independent investigation into the February 8 elections and to identify and punish “responsible personalities”. Participants were of the view that the judiciary was dismantled through the 26th and 27th Constitutional Amendments and alleged that conscientious judges , including Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, Justice Athar Minallah, and Lahore High Court Justice Shams Mehmood Mirza , were forced to leave the institution, with arrangements made to sideline the remaining judges. They further alleged that most recently, action was taken against Islamabad High Court Judge Justice Tariq Jahangiri , who was removed from his office over a fake degree. The conference claimed that these officials demanded to restore the judiciary in accordance with the original 1973 Constitution. The conference also condemned the convictions against the PTI founder and his wife and the “inhumane treatment” of Imran’s sisters, including “their being attacked by water cannons.” Additionally, the participants demanded the release of prisoners, including Imran, his wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Sarfraz Cheema, among others. TTAP also condemned the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), alleging that it was passed to curtail media freedom, additionally showing concerns over the economic strangulation of Dawn Media Group. Moreover, the participants expressed complete solidarity with journalists who “lost their jobs under the system” and denounced the narcotics case against journalist Matiullah Jan. The cases registered against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were also condemned. The opposition was also of the view that statements and reports regarding the deployment of Pakistan’s armed forces in Gaza reflected “alarming non-transparency”. They demanded that the nation be taken into confidence before any decision was made. The conference additionally cited the World Bank, claiming that over 44 per cent of Pakistan’s population lived below the poverty line, while the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) reports indicated corruption amounting to Rs 5,300 billion. They assailed the government for failing to curb unemployment, inflation, and poverty and lacked a roadmap for relief. The TTAP also expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh and Balochistan and demanded the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch detainees. The opposition alliance demanded the implementation of unanimous resolutions passed by the KP Assembly Jirga and the release of outstanding federal dues to the province. It also called for lifting the ban on the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement. They said under the 18th Amendment, minerals belonged to the provinces and that entering into international mining agreements without taking provincial governments and local populations into confidence violated it. The TTAP also demanded the immediate restoration of student unions across the country. In view of the ongoing national crisis, the conference unanimously agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.",

The conference claimed that these officials demanded to restore the judiciary in accordance with the original 1973 Constitution. The conference also condemned the convictions against the PTI founder and his wife and the “inhumane treatment” of Imran’s sisters, including “their being attacked by water cannons.” Additionally, the participants demanded the release of prisoners, including Imran, his wife Bushra Bibi and PTI leaders Shah Mehmood Qureshi, Ejaz Chaudhry, Yasmin Rashid and Sarfraz Cheema, among others. TTAP also condemned the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (Peca), alleging that it was passed to curtail media freedom, additionally showing concerns over the economic strangulation of Dawn Media Group. Moreover, the participants expressed complete solidarity with journalists who “lost their jobs under the system” and denounced the narcotics case against journalist Matiullah Jan. The cases registered against lawyers Imaan Zainab Mazari-Hazir and her husband, Hadi Ali Chatha, were also condemned. The opposition was also of the view that statements and reports regarding the deployment of Pakistan’s armed forces in Gaza reflected “alarming non-transparency”. They demanded that the nation be taken into confidence before any decision was made. The conference additionally cited the World Bank, claiming that over 44 per cent of Pakistan’s population lived below the poverty line, while the International Monetary  Fund (IMF) reports indicated corruption amounting to Rs 5,300 billion. They assailed the government for failing to curb unemployment, inflation, and poverty and lacked a roadmap for relief. The TTAP also expressed concern over the deteriorating law and order situation in Sindh and Balochistan and demanded the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief Dr Mahrang Baloch and other Baloch detainees. The opposition alliance demanded the implementation of unanimous resolutions passed by the KP Assembly Jirga and the release of outstanding federal dues to the province. It also called for lifting the ban on the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement. They said under the 18th Amendment, minerals belonged to the provinces and that entering into international mining agreements without taking provincial governments and local populations into confidence violated it. The TTAP also demanded the immediate restoration of student unions across the country. In view of the ongoing national crisis, the conference unanimously agreed that the door to dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces have killed nine terrorists as a result of two separate operations in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said in a statement on Sunday. According to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 19 December 2025, nine khwarij belonging to Indian proxy fitna al khwarij were killed in two separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.” Fitna-al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It added that the first intelligence-based operation (IBO) was carried out on the reported presence of terrorists in the Dera Ismail Khan district of the province. “During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij ’s location, and after an intense fire exchange, four khwarij were sent to hell.” Per the statement, the second IBO was conducted in the Bannu district. “In ensuing fire exchange, five more khwarij were effectively neutralised by the security forces.” The ISPR said that weapons and ammunition were also recovered from the slain terrorists, who had remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities against the security forces, law enforcement agencies, and the target killing of innocent civilians. “Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other Indian-sponsored kharji found in the area, as a relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision “Azm e Istehkam” (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by the security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign sponsored and supported terrorism from the country,” it said. Earlier this year, Pakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent as compared to the previous year. The Global Terrorism Index 2025 , published by the Institute for Economics and Peace (IEP), provides a comprehensive summary of the key trends and patterns in terrorism over the last 17 years. Last week, security forces had killed 13 terrorists in two operations in Mohmand and Bannu districts of the province.",

      "summary_orig": "Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar stressed on Sunday the need for a national dialogue, saying Pakistan required political and economic stability as the country remains mired in political clashes between the government and the opposition. “Politics is the name of a continuous process,“ he said, as he addressed a seminar in Lahore. “No country or nation can progress amid political and economic instability.” The relationship between the government and the opposition has come under additional strain in recent weeks, especially after the military’s spokesperson, Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, assailed incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan as a “national security threat”, triggering a strong reaction . Moreover, Imran, who is already facing a slew of legal cases, was once again sentenced to 17 years of imprisonment in the Toshakhana 2 case on Saturday, making his release uncertain. The law minister stated that the country had witnessed cultures of tolerance as well as violence, emphasising that it was the duty of politicians to “balance out” these tendencies and pave a way through “dialogue”. He emphasised that all politicians must play their role in preventing violence and extremism from paving the way into politics. “We feel the need for a national dialogue, only for the sake of our beloved country.“ Emphasising restraint and respect for dissent, he called for “listening to opponents, embracing positive criticism, and forging a national political charter to ensure stability”. Meanwhile, the Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) – the grand opposition alliance headed by Mahmood Khan Achakzai – is currently holding a two-day national conference in Islamabad. The alliance had also called for a national dialogue in all parties’ conference in August, calling for a new charter of democracy between all political stakeholders. “The parties participating in the TTAP and its All-Party Conference (APC) agreed that at this time there is an urgent need for a new democratic charter among all political parties and political forces,” they said. National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq had also shown his willingness to facilitate a dialogue between the government and the opposition parties. However, there has been no formal initiation of the dialogue between the government and the opposition since last year. PM’s advisor warns against ‘confrontation and violence’ Speaking at the same event, the Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah said political stability can only be achieved through “restraint, mutual respect and sustained dialogue.” He warned that “confrontation and violence” had repeatedly derailed Pakistan’s democratic course. “No nation can progress through fighting, chaos and disorder,” adding that attacks on defence installations were “gravely wrong” and unacceptable. He argued that political instability emerges when parties abandon dialogue for confrontation, stressing that the government has repeatedly offered talks. “Tell us — who is refusing dialogue? If it is us, we will correct ourselves; if it is someone else, name them,” he said. Rejecting claims that the general elections were selectively fair or unfair, Sanaullah recalled that even in 2018, the opposition alleged mandate theft, yet extended an offer to work together in parliament — an offer that was rebuffed with threats of imprisonment by Imran. “If elections are disputed, political parties — not the establishment — must decide the way forward. Political stability is essential for national progress.” Sanaullah also cited overtures made before the passage of this year’s budget, saying Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly invited the opposition for talks, including in the presence of the military leadership, proposing a ‘Charter of Pakistan’. “Who is declining political dialogue?” he asked again, urging clarity to remove ambiguities blocking stability. The former interior minister said, noting that while second-tier leadership within the PTI favours dialogue, fear of backlash from within the party’s ranks had stifled it. Saad Rafique calls for Charters of Democracy and Economy Senior PML-N leader Khawaja Saad Rafique called for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, warning against inter-provincial polarisation and repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote. Rafique underscored that confrontation and chaos cannot strengthen the state, warning that repeated assaults on the sanctity of the vote had eroded public trust. Calling for a Charter of Democracy and a Charter of Economy, he urged “engagement with all constitutional forces and dialogue with institutions to reduce political pressure and restore stability”.",

      "summary_orig": "Pakistan produced a dominant all-round performance to thrash arch-rivals India by a massive 191 runs in the final of the U-19 Asia Cup at the ICC Academy Ground on Sunday, claiming the prestigious title in emphatic fashion. Opener Sameer Minhas lit up the first half of the match with a record-breaking 172 — the highest individual score in a U-19 Asia Cup final — propelling Pakistan to a formidable 347 for 8 after being asked to bat first. In reply, India’s much-vaunted batting line-up crumbled spectacularly, folding for a paltry 156 in just 26.2 overs as pacer Ali Raza ripped through the order with figures of 4 for 42. The victory marked a sweet redemption for Pakistan, who had suffered a heavy defeat to the same opponents in the group stage and had entered the final as underdogs against an unbeaten Indian side. Instead, it was Pakistan who delivered a clinical display, overwhelming India in every department to lift the trophy amid jubilant celebrations. India captain Ayush Mhatre won the toss and elected to bowl, perhaps hoping to restrict Pakistan on a surface expected to assist the seamers early on. However, the decision backfired spectacularly as Sameer launched a brutal assault from the outset. After Hamza Zahoor fell early for 18, Sameer combined with Usman Khan (35) and Ahmed Hussain (56) in substantial partnerships — 92 for the second wicket and 137 for the third — to put Pakistan in complete command. The right-hander brought up his century off 71 balls and raced to 172 off 113 deliveries, studded with 17 fours and nine sixes, before falling to a slower ball from Deepesh Devendran in the 43rd over. A late flurry of wickets — five falling for 45 runs in the final overs — prevented Pakistan from reaching 400, but their total remained the highest ever posted in a U-19 Asia Cup final. Khilan Patel was the pick of India’s bowlers with 2 for 44, while Devendran claimed 3 for 83. Chasing 348, India started explosively, racing to 21 in the first over off Ali Raza, with Vaibhav Suryavanshi smashing a six and four in an over that also included a no-ball and extras. Suryavanshi continued the onslaught, striking three sixes and a four in his blistering 26 off 10 balls. But the introduction of spin and disciplined pace turned the tide irreversibly. Captain Mhatre (2) holed out to mid-off, Aaron George (16 off 9) miscued a pull, and Suryavanshi nicked behind — all falling to Raza and Mohammad Sayyam as India slipped to 49 for 3 in the fifth over. The collapse deepened. Vihaan Malhotra (7) was bowled attempting a rash pull off Abdul Subhan, Vedant Trivedi (9) found short midwicket, and Abhigyan Kundu (13) upper-cut to deep third. Kanishk Chouhan (9) and Khilan Patel (19) offered brief resistance, but regular strikes kept India on the back foot. Lower down, Deepesh Devendran provided late entertainment with a quickfire 36 off 16 balls, including six fours and two sixes, but his dismissal — skying one to point off Raza — ended any lingering hopes. Subhan (2-29) and off-spinner Huzaifa Ahsan (2-12) chipped in effectively, while Sayyam supported with 2 for 38. India’s innings lasted a mere 26.2 overs, underscoring Pakistan’s bowling dominance and fielding sharpness after the break. The margin of victory was the largest in a U-19 Asia Cup final, completing a comprehensive rout. Man of the Match Sameer was hoisted onto his team-mates’ shoulders as Pakistan celebrated wildly, while India, unbeaten until the final, were left to rue a day when nothing went right.",
