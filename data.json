      "summary_orig": "The UN Security Council is set to vote Monday on a US-drafted resolution bolstering Donald Trump’s Gaza peace plan , especially the deployment of an international force, as Washington warns that a failure to act could lead to renewed fighting. The draft, which has been revised several times as a result of high-stakes negotiations, “endorses” the plan, which allowed for a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to take hold on October 10 in the war-wracked Palestinian territory. The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of fighting , sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The latest version of the text, seen by AFP , authorises the creation of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) that would work with Israel and Egypt and newly trained Palestinian police to help secure border areas and demilitarise the Gaza Strip. The ISF also would work on the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” protecting civilians and securing humanitarian aid corridors. In addition, it would authorise the formation of a “Board of Peace,” a transitional governing body for Gaza — which Trump would theoretically chair — with a mandate running until the end of 2027. Unlike previous drafts, the latest version mentions a possible future Palestinian state. Once the Palestinian Authority has carried out requested reforms and the rebuilding of Gaza is underway, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft says. That eventuality has been firmly rejected by Israel. “Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. However, Hamas and other armed groups have criticised the draft resolution, warning it would pave the way for foreign control over Palestinian decision-making, Al Jazeera reports. The group said it would hand Gaza’s governance and reconstruction to a supranational body, stripping Palestinians of self-rule, and described plans for an international force as imposing foreign guardianship. The factions insisted that humanitarian aid should be managed by Palestinian institutions under UN supervision and also rejected disarming Gaza or curbing the right to resist. Hamas called for international mechanisms to hold Israel accountable for rights abuses and border control policies. The UN Security Council vote is set for 2200 GMT (3:00 am on Tuesday Pakistan time). Russian objections Veto-wielding Russia has circulated a competing draft, saying the US document does not go far enough towards backing the creation of a Palestinian state. Moscow’s text, seen by AFP , asks the Council to express its “unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution”. It does not authorise a Board of Peace or the deployment of an international force for the time being, instead asking UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to offer “options” on those issues. The United States has intensified its campaign to earn support for its resolution, hitting out at “attempts to sow discord” among Council members. “Any refusal to back this resolution is a vote either for the continued reign of Hamas terrorists or for the return to war with Israel, condemning the region and its people to perpetual conflict,” the US ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, wrote in The Washington Post . The US has made known that it has the backing of several Arab and Muslim-majority nations, publishing a joint statement of support for the text signed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan, and Turkey. Several diplomats told AFP that despite Russian criticism and hesitance on the part of other member states, they expect the US draft to be adopted. “We expect broad support for the resolution,” said one diplomat at the UN, requesting anonymity to discuss negotiations on the resolution. “Although Russia has at times hinted at a possible veto, it would be difficult to oppose a text backed by Palestine and the region.” That would likely also be the case for China, which also holds a veto, the diplomat said. “The Russians know that while a lot of Council members will go along with the US plans, they share concerns about the substance of the US text and the way Washington has tried to fast-track it through New York,” Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group told AFP . He, however, said he doubts that Moscow will use its veto on a resolution backed by Arab nations. “I think it is more likely that China and Russia will abstain, register their skepticism about the plan and then sit back and watch the US struggle to put it into action,” Gowan said. ‘Suspicious’ flights from Israel show ‘agenda to cleanse Palestinians’ South Africa said today that the surprise arrival of 153 Palestinians on a plane last week indicated “a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians” out of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The group landed in Johannesburg on a chartered flight last Thursday without departure stamps from Israel in their passports. Reports said a shadowy organisation named Al-Majd was involved in their travel from Gaza. “We are suspicious, as the South African government, about the circumstances surrounding the arrival of the plane,” Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told reporters. South African border police kept the group on the plane for 12 hours before President Cyril Ramaphosa allowed them entry on a standard 90-day visa exemption. It emerged later that a previous flight carrying 176 Palestinians had arrived on October 28, according to the local Gift of the Givers charity that is assisting the arrivals. “We do not want any further flights to come our way because this is a clear agenda to cleanse out Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank and those areas, which South Africa is against,” Lamola said. “It does look like it represents a broader agenda to remove Palestinians from Palestine into many different parts of the world, and is a clearly orchestrated operation,” he said, without providing further details.",

The draft, which has been revised several times as a result of high-stakes negotiations, “endorses” the plan, which allowed for a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas to take hold on October 10 in the war-wracked Palestinian territory. The Gaza Strip has been largely reduced to rubble after two years of fighting , sparked by Hamas’s attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. The latest version of the text, seen by AFP , authorises the creation of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) that would work with Israel and Egypt and newly trained Palestinian police to help secure border areas and demilitarise the Gaza Strip. The ISF also would work on the “permanent decommissioning of weapons from non-state armed groups,” protecting civilians and securing humanitarian aid corridors. In addition, it would authorise the formation of a “Board of Peace,” a transitional governing body for Gaza — which Trump would theoretically chair — with a mandate running until the end of 2027. Unlike previous drafts, the latest version mentions a possible future Palestinian state. Once the Palestinian Authority has carried out requested reforms and the rebuilding of Gaza is underway, “the conditions may finally be in place for a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood,” the draft says. That eventuality has been firmly rejected by Israel. “Our opposition to a Palestinian state on any territory has not changed,” Netanyahu said at a cabinet meeting on Sunday. However, Hamas and other armed groups have criticised the draft resolution, warning it would pave the way for foreign control over Palestinian decision-making, Al Jazeera reports. The group said it would hand Gaza’s governance and reconstruction to a supranational body, stripping Palestinians of self-rule, and described plans for an international force as imposing foreign guardianship. The factions insisted that humanitarian aid should be managed by Palestinian institutions under UN supervision and also rejected disarming Gaza or curbing the right to resist. Hamas called for international mechanisms to hold Israel accountable for rights abuses and border control policies. The UN Security Council vote is set for 2200 GMT (3:00 am on Tuesday Pakistan time). Russian objections Veto-wielding Russia has circulated a competing draft, saying the US document does not go far enough towards backing the creation of a Palestinian state. Moscow’s text, seen by AFP , asks the Council to express its “unwavering commitment to the vision of the two-state solution”. It does not authorise a Board of Peace or the deployment of an international force for the time being, instead asking UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to offer “options” on those issues. The United States has intensified its campaign to earn support for its resolution, hitting out at “attempts to sow discord” among Council members. “Any refusal to back this resolution is a vote either for the continued reign of Hamas terrorists or for the return to war with Israel, condemning the region and its people to perpetual conflict,” the US ambassador to the United Nations, Mike Waltz, wrote in The Washington Post . The US has made known that it has the backing of several Arab and Muslim-majority nations, publishing a joint statement of support for the text signed by Qatar, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan, and Turkey. Several diplomats told AFP that despite Russian criticism and hesitance on the part of other member states, they expect the US draft to be adopted. “We expect broad support for the resolution,” said one diplomat at the UN, requesting anonymity to discuss negotiations on the resolution. “Although Russia has at times hinted at a possible veto, it would be difficult to oppose a text backed by Palestine and the region.” That would likely also be the case for China, which also holds a veto, the diplomat said. “The Russians know that while a lot of Council members will go along with the US plans, they share concerns about the substance of the US text and the way Washington has tried to fast-track it through New York,” Richard Gowan of the International Crisis Group told AFP . He, however, said he doubts that Moscow will use its veto on a resolution backed by Arab nations. “I think it is more likely that China and Russia will abstain, register their skepticism about the plan and then sit back and watch the US struggle to put it into action,” Gowan said. ‘Suspicious’ flights from Israel show ‘agenda to cleanse Palestinians’ South Africa said today that the surprise arrival of 153 Palestinians on a plane last week indicated “a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians” out of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. The group landed in Johannesburg on a chartered flight last Thursday without departure stamps from Israel in their passports. Reports said a shadowy organisation named Al-Majd was involved in their travel from Gaza. “We are suspicious, as the South African government, about the circumstances surrounding the arrival of the plane,” Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola told reporters. South African border police kept the group on the plane for 12 hours before President Cyril Ramaphosa allowed them entry on a standard 90-day visa exemption. It emerged later that a previous flight carrying 176 Palestinians had arrived on October 28, according to the local Gift of the Givers charity that is assisting the arrivals. “We do not want any further flights to come our way because this is a clear agenda to cleanse out Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank and those areas, which South Africa is against,” Lamola said. “It does look like it represents a broader agenda to remove Palestinians from Palestine into many different parts of the world, and is a clearly orchestrated operation,” he said, without providing further details.",

      "summary_orig": "Lahore, once celebrated as the City of Gardens, now chokes each winter under a grey shroud of smog — its skies thick with toxic haze that has become the city’s defining feature . Every November, as the monsoon fades, a suffocating layer of smoke and dust engulfs Lahore, India’s capital New Delhi and much of northern South Asia. The mix of crop burning, vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions drives air pollution to deadly levels, forcing authorities to shut schools, businesses and highways. This winter, as air quality plummets again, the Punjab government is betting on an unconventional ally to fight back: artificial intelligence (AI). Authorities say they are deploying one of the region’s most technologically advanced clean-air programmes, with AI systems at the centre of forecasting, enforcement and public response. Some 100 AI-powered air-quality monitoring stations have been established across Punjab, home to nearly 130 million people, according to Punjab Environment Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb. These smart stations continuously analyse pollution data using machine-learning algorithms to predict air-quality surges before they occur. The information feeds into a 24-hour “smog war room” — a real-time climate intelligence hub integrating satellite feeds, ground sensors and international databases. Aurangzeb told Anadolu that across major industrial and urban centres, 8,500 cameras, drones and thermal sensors are linked to this AI dashboard, tracking emissions from factories and brick kilns. “Each emission source is geo-tagged, QR-coded, and algorithmically assessed for compliance,” she said. From smoke to smart data Punjab has also created a specialised Environmental Protection Force (EPF) digitally connected to the AI command centre. When sensors detect an emission spike, nearby EPF units receive automatic alerts and are dispatched with drones and smart devices to verify violations and seal polluting sites. Another innovation is the deployment of AI-guided anti-smog guns across Lahore, programmed to activate automatically when particulate levels exceed safe limits. Early pilot tests showed a 70 per cent improvement in air quality in Lahore’s Kahna area within hours of operation, Aurangzeb said. Citizens are also part of the digital ecosystem. Through the Air Quality Index Punjab app , Green Punjab app and helpline 1373, residents can report pollution sources directly. The system categorises complaints and assigns them automatically — with a reported 96pc closure rate. Using satellite data from Nasa and Pakistan Space & Upper Atmosphere Research Commission, the AI network also detects crop-burning incidents in real time and cross-references them with farm-loan databases to target enforcement. According to the government, the system has helped reduce stubble burning by 65pc in a year, while in Punjab’s industrial belt, it says 95pc of factories now operate under emission-control systems. ‘No silver bullet’ for smog But while AI may be transforming enforcement, experts caution that technology alone cannot solve Pakistan’s deep-rooted pollution crisis. Air pollution kills an estimated 128,000 Pakistanis each year, according to Fair Finance Pakistan. Analysts say real progress requires cleaner fuels, modern refineries and a shift away from outdated industrial practices. Imran Saqib Khalid, a climate governance expert in Islamabad, said Lahore’s smog cannot be fixed without tackling its primary sources. “Vehicular emissions contribute significantly to air pollution in Lahore, which can be addressed through the use of high-quality fuel, along with an improved public transport system,” he told Anadolu . Pakistan, he said, lacks modern refineries capable of producing cleaner fuel. “Although we have started to import improved-quality fuel, it is not enough to meet our needs.” Khalid also pointed to the country’s thousands of brick kilns, many of which burn low-quality coal or even old tyres. “Even the so-called ‘zigzag technology’ kilns fail to meet national environmental standards because of poor-quality fuel,” he said, adding that zigzag firing, while efficient in theory, “cannot deliver results without fuel reform”. “Air pollution is a complex issue but it has been addressed elsewhere in the world. It will take time and effort — there is no silver bullet solution,” he said. “It cannot be done through surface-level measures such as smog guns and smog towers.” Environmentalists acknowledge that Punjab’s use of AI marks a new seriousness in tackling smog, but they say lasting improvements demand systemic reforms. Yasir Hussain, a Karachi-based environmentalist, said the government’s approach this year shows more coordination than previous efforts but still lacks long-term impact. “Artificial rain and smog guns don’t have a permanent or lasting effect,” he said. “Within an hour, pollution levels return because so much gas and particulate matter come from vehicles, industrial units, brick kilns and stubble burning.” He believes the electric vehicle policy introduced this year could make a difference over time. “This government has taken some measures to mitigate smog, but there is a long way to go,” he added.",

CAFs are defined as a federal paramilitary force working under the interior ministry, according to Section 18, sub-section 21 of Schedule II of the Rules of Business, 1973 , such as the Federal Constabulary, Frontier Corps, Gilgit-Baltistan Scouts and Pakistan Coast Guards. The decision to revise compensation to be on par with the Islamabad police was made by the interior ministry in August this year and approved by the cabinet on August 25. According to today’s notification, the minimum compensation will be Rs10 million (Grade 1-9), while the maximum is now Rs20m (Grade 20 and above). “If a member of the CAFs is shaheed (martyred), permanently disabled, injured with serious injury or minor injury, as the case may be, while on bona fide government duty, an award under these rules may be granted to him or his family, as the case may be,” the notification read. The package also includes Rs3m in cash compensation in the event of being “incapacitated and released from services for having become invalid as a result of injury in encounters, bomb blasts, riots or watch and ward duty or terrorist activity”. Rs1m in compensation would be provided to personnel incapacitated in the aforementioned incidents listed, but who are still serving in the department. Serious injury would award Rs200,000, while minor injury would award compensation of Rs100,000. In 2020, compensation amounts were revised so that the deaths and injuries of civil armed forces personnel “related to security” would award maximum compensation of Rs3m (Grade 1-16) and a maximum of Rs10m (Grade 20 and above).",

      "title_orig": "No-confidence ousts Haq in AJK; PPP’s Rathore takes over premiership",
      "summary_orig": "A no-confidence motion against Azad Jammu and Kashmir Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq succeeded on Monday, with 36 members in the Legislative Assembly voting in favour of it and two against it. Of the 29 PPP members, the speaker could not cast his vote and of the 9 PML-N members, one female member abstained. Two PTI legislators — regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and leader of the opposition Khawaja Farooq Ahmed — voted against the move. Haq, who had arrived in the hall along with four loyalists, left along with them soon after delivering his speech. Three PTI members did not attend. One member each of the Muslim Conference and the Jammu Kashmir Peoples Party (JKPP) also abstained. Apart from them, three PTI forward bloc members — Ansar Abdali, Mazhar Saeed and deputy speaker Chaudhry Riaz — also abstained. After the votes were counted, AJK Assembly Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, who was chairing the session, announced PPP’s Raja Faisal Mumtaz Rathore as the new premier. Under the AJK Constitution, a vote of no confidence against the sitting prime minister automatically counts as a vote in favour of the lawmaker proposed as his successor in the same resolution. Rathore is the 16th prime minister elected in AJK since 1975, when the parliamentary form of government was introduced in the region. The newly elected prime minister said that the change would be felt not only in faces but in the system itself — and that this would be the true measure of success. Announcing several administrative measures, he said secretaries would be entitled to only one official vehicle and that the total number of secretaries would not exceed 20. He also declared the abolition of the posts of special secretary and senior additional secretary. He said the downsizing process would be carried down to the lowest tiers. Rathire announced the merger of the Education Department’s technical wing into the department and the drafting of a fresh transport policy. Until the new policy was finalised, no officer below grade 18 — except those in administration, the police and monitoring assistant engineers — would be permitted to use an official vehicle. All departments, the AJK premier said, would be required to deposit extra government vehicles into the official transport pool within a week. There would be no compromise on biometric verification. He ordered the Public Service Commission (PSC) to be reactivated and announced the cancellation of notifications for posts that had been advertised through the PSC and then withdrawn up to January 1, 2020. The PSC would hold examinations within a month and appoint qualified candidates to those posts. The AJK premier further announced that for appointments up to grade 18 — except where recruitment was 100 per cent quota-based — at least 50pc of vacancies would be filled through direct recruitment. All departments were directed to implement this within a month. He said the government would fully implement the Third-Party Act in accordance with the high court’s decision. The law would be enforced not only in government departments but also in semi-government organisations and autonomous bodies, including the Bank of AJK. A uniform time-scale policy, Rathire said, would be introduced across all departments, with no time-scale increases granted above grade 19. In departments where section officer and assistant director posts existed, all admin officer positions would be abolished. To address public grievances, the prime minister, ministers, the chief secretary, secretaries and department heads would hold open courts in every district. Complaint boxes would be installed in the offices of the prime minister and the chief secretary and opened every 15 days under their joint supervision. Judicial reforms would also be introduced, in consultation with the superior judiciary, to ensure administrative justice. Regarding hydropower projects, the AJK PM said an agreement with the federal government would be secured in cooperation with the PML-N leadership. Improving internet speeds and strengthening the local government system were also listed as priorities. Referring to the needs of low-paid staff, he said that as the son of Raja Mumtaz Hussain Rathore, he felt a duty of care toward junior employees, and had therefore decided to regularise all Grade-1 employees serving in permanent posts — provided they had no pending court cases and the move did not affect anyone’s pension or legal rights. He also announced one month’s additional salary for all Grade-1 employees, to be paid from departmental development budgets. He ordered that all driver posts be upgraded to Grade-5 and said police constables would receive facilities and allowances on par with those in Punjab. Police personnel performing duties alongside important individuals would be eligible for travel and dearness allowance. He also announced a remission of 60 days from the sentences of prisoners in all AJK jails — except those convicted under qisas, diyat, espionage, anti-state activities or terrorism, where the remission would not apply. At the conclusion of his speech, the prime minister reaffirmed AJK’s “unwavering support for the people of occupied Kashmir”. Earlier, when the speaker announced the results of voting and asked Rathore to take the seat reserved for the leader of the house, the prime minister-elect — dressed in qameez shalwar and a black coat — shook hands with or embraced lawmakers in the front row, including the two lone PTI legislators. Before Rathore’s address, PPP regional president Chaudhry Muhammad Yasin, PML-N regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir, his predecessor Raja Farooq Haider, PTI regional president Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi and several others also spoke. Earlier still, the outgoing prime minister had delivered a speech shortly after the session began. He said he was leaving “in a dignified manner with a contented heart” and held no grievance against any of the pro-no-trust lawmakers, most of whom were still members of his cabinet. “I came to thank you for relieving me of this responsibility on the one hand and to set the record straight on the other,” he said. While asserting his “commitment to the ideology of the state’s accession to Pakistan, the armed forces and the Kashmir freedom movement”, he said those who had drafted the no-trust resolution should have consulted him first. “My best wishes are with the new government. We will play a constructive role in the opposition. If the government performs well, we will support it shoulder to shoulder. But if there is any attempt to crush the aspirations of the people of AJK, we will resort to such a severe protest that no one has ever seen before.” However, PTI’s Niazi mocked the outgoing premier’s claim, saying his tenure had witnessed “the worst-ever disgrace of the system and state institutions, including the Legislative Assembly”. Niazi also strongly criticised the votes cast in favour of the no-trust motion by PTI renegades, calling it an insult to the public mandate. “This whole process is unlawful. We will take legal action against those who returned to the Assembly on PTI tickets and then crossed the floor,” he warned. No-confidence motion The no-trust motion was tabled by PPP lawmaker Qasim Majeed in the assembly today, after a resolution for a no-confidence vote against outgoing PM Haq was submitted to the Assembly Secretariat on Friday afternoon. The resolution was signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N. Shortly after today’s session began, Haq also arrived in the house. He went up to Rathore and exchanged greetings with him. Haq left after delivering a speech. People view proceedings of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir Assembly live on big screen installed outside the assembly’s building on Nov 17. — Photo by Tariq Naqash Big screens were installed outside the assembly’s building, where people viewed the proceedings live. Haq’s loss seemed certain even before the no-confidence motion was tabled against him today as the PPP had the guaranteed support of at least 29 lawmakers — two more than the requisite number needed for the motion to succeed. In October, the PPP’s ranks in the AJK Legislative Assembly had swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the PTI forward bloc joined the party. On Sunday, two more PTI lawmakers, said to be from the party’s forward bloc — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur. With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, Rathore is the fourth prime minister elected in AJK in four years. In August 2021, the PTI picked Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan. Niazi had secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house. After nine months, Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. In April 2023, Tanveer was disqualified by the full court bench of the AJK High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Haq.",

Earlier still, the outgoing prime minister had delivered a speech shortly after the session began. He said he was leaving “in a dignified manner with a contented heart” and held no grievance against any of the pro-no-trust lawmakers, most of whom were still members of his cabinet. “I came to thank you for relieving me of this responsibility on the one hand and to set the record straight on the other,” he said. While asserting his “commitment to the ideology of the state’s accession to Pakistan, the armed forces and the Kashmir freedom movement”, he said those who had drafted the no-trust resolution should have consulted him first. “My best wishes are with the new government. We will play a constructive role in the opposition. If the government performs well, we will support it shoulder to shoulder. But if there is any attempt to crush the aspirations of the people of AJK, we will resort to such a severe protest that no one has ever seen before.” However, PTI’s Niazi mocked the outgoing premier’s claim, saying his tenure had witnessed “the worst-ever disgrace of the system and state institutions, including the Legislative Assembly”. Niazi also strongly criticised the votes cast in favour of the no-trust motion by PTI renegades, calling it an insult to the public mandate. “This whole process is unlawful. We will take legal action against those who returned to the Assembly on PTI tickets and then crossed the floor,” he warned. No-confidence motion The no-trust motion was tabled by PPP lawmaker Qasim Majeed in the assembly today, after a resolution for a no-confidence vote against outgoing PM Haq was submitted to the Assembly Secretariat on Friday afternoon. The resolution was signed by 25 lawmakers, 23 from the PPP and two from the PML-N. Shortly after today’s session began, Haq also arrived in the house. He went up to Rathore and exchanged greetings with him. Haq left after delivering a speech.

Haq’s loss seemed certain even before the no-confidence motion was tabled against him today as the PPP had the guaranteed support of at least 29 lawmakers — two more than the requisite number needed for the motion to succeed. In October, the PPP’s ranks in the AJK Legislative Assembly had swelled to 27 after 10 lawmakers from the PTI forward bloc joined the party. On Sunday, two more PTI lawmakers, said to be from the party’s forward bloc — Minister for Elementary Education Deewan Ali Chughtai and Minister for Small Industries Corporation Taqdees Kausar Gillani — announced their decision to join the PPP after meeting Faryal Talpur. With almost six months remaining in the assembly’s term, Rathore is the fourth prime minister elected in AJK in four years. In August 2021, the PTI picked Niazi as the premier after he was named for the slot by then-PM Imran Khan. Niazi had secured 35 votes against the joint opposition candidate Latif Akbar, who bagged only 15 votes, in the 53-seat house. After nine months, Niazi resigned from the position and was replaced by PTI regional president Sardar Tanveer Ilyas. In April 2023, Tanveer was disqualified by the full court bench of the AJK High Court from being a member of the legislative assembly for contempt. He was then replaced by Haq.",

      "summary_orig": "A Bangladesh court sentenced ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to death on Monday, concluding a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on a student-led uprising last year. The ruling comes months ahead of parliamentary elections expected to be held in early February. Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting and it is feared that Monday’s verdict could stoke fresh unrest ahead of the vote. The International Crimes Tribunal, Bangladesh’s domestic war crimes court located in the capital Dhaka, delivered the guilty verdict amid tight security and in Hasina’s absence after she fled to India in August 2024. View this post on Instagram Hasina, 78, defied court orders that she return from India to attend her trial about whether she ordered a deadly crackdown against the student-led uprising that ousted her. She called the guilty verdict and death sentence in her crimes against humanity trial “biased and politically motivated”. “The verdicts announced against me have been made by a rigged tribunal established and presided over by an unelected government with no democratic mandate,” Hasina said in a statement issued from hiding in India. “They are biased and politically motivated. “ The verdict can be appealed in the Supreme Court. But Hasina’s son and adviser, Sajeeb Wazed , told Reuters on the eve of the verdict that they would not appeal unless a democratically elected government took office with the Awami League’s participation. View this post on Instagram After the verdict, Bangladesh urged India to extradite Hasina and former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal. Dhaka said New Delhi was obliged to do so under an extradition treaty. India’s foreign ministry said that it had “noted” the verdict, adding it was “committed to the best interests of the people of Bangladesh”. It did not comment immediately on Bangladesh’s extradition request. Worst violence since 1971 During the trial, prosecutors told the court that they had uncovered evidence of her direct command to use lethal force to suppress a student-led uprising in July and August 2024. According to a United Nations report, up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests between July 15 and August 5, 2024, with thousands more injured — most of them by gunfire from security forces — in what was the worst violence in Bangladesh since its 1971 war of independence. Hasina was represented by a state-appointed defence counsel who told the court that the charges against her were baseless and pleaded for her acquittal. Ahead of the verdict, Hasina dismissed the accusations and the fairness of the Tribunal proceedings, asserting a guilty verdict was “a foregone conclusion”. Bangladesh has been tense ahead of the verdict, with at least 30 crude bomb explosions and 26 vehicles torched across the country over the past few days. There have been no casualties, however.",

The Foreign Office (FO) said he would lead the Pakistani delegation at the summit, being held on November 17-18, at the invitation of Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Vladmirovich Mishustin. “The CHG will be attended by the heads of government of Belarus, China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the vice president of Iran, and the foreign ministers of Pakistan and India,” the statement said. Further, in addition to SCO member states, the heads of the governments of Mongolia, Bahrain, Egypt, Qatar, Kuwait and Turkmenistan will also be attending the meeting alongside those of regional/international organisations, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, Euro Asian Economic Union, Collective Security Treaty Organisation and Democratic Socialists of America. “In his address to the SCO CHG, the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s perspective on important regional and global issues as well as ways to strengthen the organisation for the benefit of the SCO region,” the statement added. Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with the leaders of other SCO countries on the sidelines of the summit, the FO added. The CHG is the second-highest decision-making institution in the SCO and provides guidance in the areas of economy, finance, trade, connectivity, commerce and socio-economic cooperation, including the organisation’s budgetary matters, according to the FO. The SCO CHG adopts joint communiqué, statements and important decisions. The SCO held a summit in Tianjin, China, from August 31 to September 1 earlier this year. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also announced in September announced that Pakistan would be hosting the next SCO summit, but did not provide a date.",

      "title_orig": "Saudi crown prince visits US with security, AI and nuclear on the agenda",
      "summary_orig": "A visit by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler to the White House for talks on Tuesday with United States President Donald Trump aims to deepen decades-old cooperation on oil and security while broadening ties in commerce, technology and potentially even nuclear energy. It will be the first trip by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the US since the 2018 killing of Saudi critic Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi agents in Istanbul, which caused a global uproar. US intelligence concluded that MBS approved the capture or killing of Khashoggi, a prominent critic. The crown prince, widely known by his initials MBS, denied ordering the operation but acknowledged responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto ruler. More than seven years later, the world’s largest economy and the world’s top oil producer want to move forward. Trump is seeking to cash in on a $600 billion Saudi investment pledge made during Trump’s visit to the kingdom in May. He steered clear of mentioning human rights concerns during that trip and is expected to do so again. The Saudi leader is seeking security guarantees amid regional turmoil and wants access to artificial intelligence technology and progress toward a deal on a civilian nuclear programme. “There is a page that has been turned” on Khashoggi’s killing, said Aziz Alghashian, Saudi-based lecturer of international relations at Naif Arab University for Security Sciences. Focus on defence deal The US and Saudi Arabia have long had an arrangement for the kingdom to sell oil at favourable prices and for the superpower to provide security in exchange. That equation was shaken by Washington’s failure to act when Iran struck oil installations in the kingdom in 2019. Concerns resurfaced in September, when Israel struck Doha, Qatar, in an attack it said targeted members of Palestinian group Hamas. In the aftermath, Trump signed a defence pact with Qatar via executive order. Many analysts, diplomats and regional officials believe the Saudis will get something similar. Saudi Arabia has sought a defence pact ratified by the US Congress in recent negotiations. But Washington has made that contingent on the kingdom normalising ties with Israel. Riyadh has, in turn, linked that to a commitment from Israel’s government, the most right-wing in its history, to Palestinian statehood. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who agreed to a Trump-brokered ceasefire with Hamas in Gaza last month after two years of fighting, on Sunday reaffirmed his staunch opposition to Palestinian independence. A Trump executive order on defence similar to the pact with Qatar would fall short of the defence agreement the Saudis have sought. But Alghashian said it would “be a step on the way, part of the process, not the end of the process”. A Western diplomat based in the Gulf summed up the dynamic: “Trump wants normalisation and Saudi wants a full defence pact, but the circumstances don’t allow. In the end, both sides will likely get less than they want. That’s diplomacy.” Dennis Ross, a former Middle East negotiator for Democratic and Republican administrations now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said he expects an executive order that would call for the US and the Saudis “to immediately consult on what to do in response to the threat” while not committing Washington to actively come to the defence of Riyadh. “That could run the gamut of providing a range of different assistance, replacing arms, deploying defensive missile batteries like THAAD or Patriot, deploying naval forces with a Marine unit to actively taking part in the combat in an offensive, not only defensive manner,” he said. Deals key amid regional rivalry Riyadh has also been pressing for deals in nuclear energy and artificial intelligence under its ambitious Vision 2030 plan to diversify its economy and strengthen its position relative to regional rivals. Securing approval to acquire advanced computer chips would be critical to the kingdom’s plans to become a central node in global AI and to compete with the United Arab Emirates, which in June signed a US multibillion-dollar data centre deal that gave it access to high-end chips. MBS also wants to strike an agreement with Washington on developing a Saudi civilian nuclear programme, part of his effort to diversify from oil. Such a deal would unlock access to US nuclear technology and security guarantees and help Saudi Arabia level up with the UAE, which has its own programme, and Iran. But progress on a US deal has been difficult because the Saudis did not want to agree to a US stipulation that would rule out enriching uranium or reprocessing spent fuel — both potential paths to a bomb. Ross said he expected an announcement of an agreement on nuclear energy, or at least a statement on progress towards one.",

      "summary_orig": "Indian army chief General Upendra Dwivedi on Monday issued a pointed warning to Pakistan, comparing the brief May conflict to a “trailer” rather than a full-length film. The Indian army chief’s remarks come a week after an explosion near the Red Fort in New Delhi on November 10, leaving 12 people dead in the first such explosion in the Indian capital since 2011 . Delivering a speech at a defence conference in New Delhi, Gen Dwivedi said, “I’d like to say that the movie hasn’t even started — only a trailer was shown, and, after the trailer, it was over within 88 hours.“ “So, we’re fully prepared for the future, and if Pakistan gives us such an opportunity, we’d like to provide them with a thorough education on how a responsible nation should behave with its neighbours.“ The conflict between the two countries in May was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Delhi blast suspect presented in court Indian anti-terrorism investigators presented a suspect linked to the bombing in court, one of two men accused of involvement in the suicide attack. Officials have not disclosed any details on the motives or organisational backing of the alleged attackers, both of whom they claim came from India-occupied Kashmir. India’s National Investiagtion Agency (NIA) alleged that Amir Rashid Ali “conspired with the alleged suicide bomber, Umarun Nabi, to unleash the terror attack” last Monday. It remains unclear whether Nabi is included in the tally. Security personnel escort the suspect from a police vehicle at the Patiala House Court, a day after his arrest, in New Delhi, India on November 17. — AFP An AFP photographer saw Ali being taken under heavy guard from a police truck to a New Delhi court to face charges. Indian media reported that the court had ordered that he be held in custody for 10 days by the NIA. Nabi was a medical professor at a university in Haryana state, just outside the capital, while Ali had allegedly travelled to Delhi to “facilitate the purchase of the car which was eventually used as a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device (IED)”, according to the NIA. India has provided no further information on the alleged motives or network behind the two suspects. Another suspect apprehended: NIA Later on Monday, the NIA said in a statement that it “arrested another key associate of the terrorist involved in the blast” in Delhi. According to the statement, the suspect was arrested from Srinagar in India-occupied Kashmir by an NIA team, with the agency stating that he “allegedly provided technical support for carrying out terror attacks by modifying drones and attempting to make rockets ahead of the deadly car bomb blast which killed 10 persons and left 32 persons injured”. “The accused, a resident of Qazigund in Anantnag district of [India-occupied Kashmir], was an active co-conspirator behind the attack and had worked closely with the terrorist, Umarun Nabi, to plan the terror carnage,” the statement read. “NIA continues to explore various angles to unravel the conspiracy behind the bombing,” it added. “Several teams of the anti-terror agency are pursuing multiple leads and are conducting searches across states to identify every person involved in the terror attack.” The Indian government has since branded the Delhi car blast a terrorist attack, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowing not to spare anyone involved in the “conspiracy” the day after the blast. Yesterday, the NIA said the blast was a “ suicide bombing ”.",

      "title_orig": "‘Pakistan has become extremely relevant,’ Tarar says of foreign policy on global stage after May skirmish",
      "summary_orig": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Monday said that Pakistan had become “extremely relevant” on the global stage after its performance during the military conflict against India in May. The conflict between the two countries in May this year was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Both governments launched diplomatic blitzes after the conflict to take their stance on the ordeal to other countries. Elaborating on Pakistan’s image and standing in the world in the conflict’s aftermath while speaking at a function, the information minister said, “In a very short span of time, we have become extremely relevant in our foreign policy. We have seen in the past two years, and especially after the May war, I think that has redefined who we are.” He said the “turning point” after the Pahalgam incident was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s open offer for an impartial and fair investigation because “we were often blamed for terror acts that were not our fault, and in fact, being the biggest victims of terrorism, there was a propaganda against Pakistan, blaming us for terrorism.” The information minister said that “you can’t be a victim and an aggressor at the same time — it’s an oxymoron, an inherent contradiction, it’s just not possible.” He said no other country could lay claim to the loss of 90,000 lives in the war against terrorism or billions in economic losses. “We are also a shield and a wall between the terrorists and the rest of the world,” Tarar added, saying that the sacrifice of any Pakistani was also for the sake of making the world a better place. The minister said the above sacrifices could not go in vain. “So, I think the time was right that the world heard our story and heard it right. By authoring this investigation just before the war, I think we had a point to prove that our hands were clean, and that point was well taken. “That turning point strengthened our fence, our alliances and countries that were on the fence; it made them realise what Pakistan stands for, and by authoring this investigation, Pakistan made a good diplomatic move which was well received the world over. I think after that, there was immense diplomatic engagement … and that constant engagement really helped us prove our point to the world. “So when I say the world was changing, Pakistan also changed; we saw an aggressive diplomatic change. Our diplomacy worked very well because we were taking it and relations with all countries very seriously. There was no laxity, and there was no room for any complacency, and we were right on the job,” the information minister said. He added that Pakistan did all it could on international media outlets. “We had the strength of the truth, so when we told the story and told it right, the world heard it, and it had an impact. So the right kind of aggressive diplomacy with the right kind of marketing campaign with the right kind of information to counter misinformation and disinformation — so we were everywhere all across,” he further said. National synergy and Gen Z Tarar also said he appreciated the “synergy” with the military’s spokesperson in putting out information, saying it would not have been possible otherwise. “So we were winning on the narrative front and the diplomatic front. When it actually came down to the brass tacks, we had already shot down seven planes and when we were confronted with brute force, we gave them a bloody noise and that befitting response proved our military might so … when it came down to the actual war, Pakistan passed with flying colours and, you know, within hours, actually within four hours, India was compelled to request for a ceasefire. “So, when I say Pakistan is changing, Pakistan actually changed. And I must acknowledge the kind of unity that we displayed as a nation. The resilience of our people, the people of Pakistan, came together, forgot our differences. I remember speaking on the floor of the house and saying that, you know, today, there is no critical point scoring, we are all on the same page, and we will fight the enemy together as a unified force, and that’s exactly what we did.” The information minister, in particular, singled out Gen Z and the use of social media and memes during the conflict. “When I say Pakistan has changed, you know, when it came down to the meme war and the enemy was stunned that our youngsters on social media had actually come up with memes in a very serious situation. And the enemy was wondering what is going on. War is a very serious matter, and they were making memes and they were ridiculing the enemy in their own particular way. “So, even our Gen Z, our younger generation, they played a role with regard to social media. And they took it upon themselves to fight for Pakistan on that platform, on that battlefield, because I often say that, you know, the digital world is divided into two kinds of people. You have digital natives and digital immigrants. “And sometimes the immigrants, you know, they take time to comprehend the ground realities of digital media. But people who are born into the digital age and they are digital natives, they understand that world much better than most of us do. So, I think the digital natives had their own war strategy and had their own way of winning that war.” Relevancy in global events Returning to his main point about Pakistan’s increased global relevance after the conflict, the minister pointed to the country’s involvement in the Gaza peace process. “If you see the way forward, Pakistan has become extremely relevant. When it comes to the situation in Gaza, when it comes to the ceasefire, we are included in the list of Arab Islamic countries that brokered that peace and were part of the negotiations which led to an eventual ceasefire. “And I think that’s a big win for Pakistan where the countries of the world have taken us extremely seriously and believe that the things that we have to say, the advice that we have to give is extremely relevant and very very important. And you have seen that we have had a lot of visits this year and people often talk about foreign visits and the dignitaries coming to Pakistan.” Referring to diplomatic engagements in the past year, he said they had been at their “peak”, saying that Pakistan hosted a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. “After 14 years, we had 12 prime ministers coming to Pakistan, coming to Islamabad and talking about strategic ties, talking about regional cooperation, talking about counter-terrorism, talking about regional connectivity. “So, we had all these things going on in succession. And even now, the way the world has engaged Pakistan, we are going to host the SCO Heads of State Summit in 2027, which is going to be a big event. And with regard to improvement of ties with other partners in the region, we saw the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement taking place with Saudi Arabia, which was, I think, one of the best things to happen to Pakistan in recent history.” Elaborating on the Saudi defence deal, he said people had taken great pride in that agreement and the people of the kingdom also celebrated the union. Tarar also mentioned the launching of the Economic Cooperation Framework, saying it had “really cemented” ties with Saudi Arabia. Acknowledgement of economic stability He said Pakistan’s economic turnaround was also acknowledged by the world. “I think that is something phenomenal because our ratings have improved, our macroeconomic indicators have improved. There is stability which the world has acknowledged. The financial institutions, the world over, are praising Pakistan’s performance in terms of the economic turnaround. So, you know, right from default to development and as I said before, from isolation to relevance. “So, these two slogans really mean a lot when it comes to the government’s performance. That we have taken the economy from default towards development and we have taken our foreign relations from isolation to relevance. And that is how I will define this journey. “And I think the future is very bright.” Situation with Afghanistan and ‘playing cards’ right The information minister also touched on the tense relations with Afghanistan after recent skirmishes and the breakdown of talks in Istanbul, saying that “there is a situation with Afghanistan where we now believe that we have an additional forum where we can present evidence of their involvement in acts of terrorism. And we have been constantly saying that we have irrefutable evidence that their land is used for acts of terrorism. “And whenever an incident takes place and when you backtrack and go into the investigations, you will find somewhere or the other an Afghan citizen involved somewhere. So, this is something which we are dealing with and we have given a very loud and clear message in that regard. “So, I think Pakistan’s situation right now in terms of its economy, foreign direct investment, strategic ties, including trade and commerce in the region, outside the region, it’s been very, very optimistic, and we have had great results so far.” Tarar also pointed to growing ties with Malaysia in terms of trade and investment. “So, I think overall in these changing circumstances, Pakistan has played its cards right, and as you saw right after the attack on Doha, the Pakistan delegation was one of the first delegations to reach Doha and express our solidarity with the Qatari leadership. “So, I think Pakistan has not only played its cards right, but Pakistan has formulated a policy where we have had a lot of successes diplomatically. And this could not have been possible without the civil and military leadership being on the same page and without that cohesion and that ideal working relationship that exists between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir. “So, I think it’s also a result, a fruit of that cohesion and synergy that exists between institutions and it’s the stability at home which has enabled us to advocate our case very, very effectively abroad and we see that a lot of other countries are desirous of improving their relations with Pakistan.” US and China The information minister touched upon the burgeoning relations between Pakistan and the United States as well, with President Donald Trump’s frequent praise of PM Shehbaz and the army chief. “I think the way President Donald Trump has more than once praised Pakistan and praised the prime minister and the field marshal and mentioned those seven planes time and time again. So, you know, that’s a point to ponder upon. And we have had a great visit to the US. “Relations have improved immensely. And the recent visit to China. So, I think Pakistan’s relationship with each country has a unique nature. So, one relationship cannot be at the cost of another relationship. And I think that’s where the success of our foreign policy lies. And that’s how we plan to go into the future with a very, very robust, with a very effective and practical foreign policy which will not only give respect to Pakistan but which will also help us to take our economy to new heights so the life of an average Pakistani can also improve.“",

So, I think the digital natives had their own war strategy and had their own way of winning that war.” Relevancy in global events Returning to his main point about Pakistan’s increased global relevance after the conflict, the minister pointed to the country’s involvement in the Gaza peace process. “If you see the way forward, Pakistan has become extremely relevant. When it comes to the situation in Gaza, when it comes to the ceasefire, we are included in the list of Arab Islamic countries that brokered that peace and were part of the negotiations which led to an eventual ceasefire. “And I think that’s a big win for Pakistan where the countries of the world have taken us extremely seriously and believe that the things that we have to say, the advice that we have to give is extremely relevant and very very important. And you have seen that we have had a lot of visits this year and people often talk about foreign visits and the dignitaries coming to Pakistan.” Referring to diplomatic engagements in the past year, he said they had been at their “peak”, saying that Pakistan hosted a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit. “After 14 years, we had 12 prime ministers coming to Pakistan, coming to Islamabad and talking about strategic ties, talking about regional cooperation, talking about counter-terrorism, talking about regional connectivity. “So, we had all these things going on in succession. And even now, the way the world has engaged Pakistan, we are going to host the SCO Heads of State Summit in 2027, which is going to be a big event. And with regard to improvement of ties with other partners in the region, we saw the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement taking place with Saudi Arabia, which was, I think, one of the best things to happen to Pakistan in recent history.” Elaborating on the Saudi defence deal, he said people had taken great pride in that agreement and the people of the kingdom also celebrated the union. Tarar also mentioned the launching of the Economic Cooperation Framework, saying it had “really cemented” ties with Saudi Arabia. Acknowledgement of economic stability He said Pakistan’s economic turnaround was also acknowledged by the world. “I think that is something phenomenal because our ratings have improved, our macroeconomic indicators have improved. There is stability which the world has acknowledged. The financial institutions, the world over, are praising Pakistan’s performance in terms of the economic turnaround. So, you know, right from default to development and as I said before, from isolation to relevance. “So, these two slogans really mean a lot when it comes to the government’s performance. That we have taken the economy from default towards development and we have taken our foreign relations from isolation to relevance. And that is how I will define this journey. “And I think the future is very bright.” Situation with Afghanistan and ‘playing cards’ right The information minister also touched on the tense relations with Afghanistan after recent skirmishes and the breakdown of talks in Istanbul, saying that “there is a situation with Afghanistan where we now believe that we have an additional forum where we can present evidence of their involvement in acts of terrorism. And we have been constantly saying that we have irrefutable evidence that their land is used for acts of terrorism. “And whenever an incident takes place and when you backtrack and go into the investigations, you will find somewhere or the other an Afghan citizen involved somewhere. So, this is something which we are dealing with and we have given a very loud and clear message in that regard. “So, I think Pakistan’s situation right now in terms of its economy, foreign direct investment, strategic ties, including trade and commerce in the region, outside the region, it’s been very, very optimistic, and we have had great results so far.” Tarar also pointed to growing ties with Malaysia in terms of trade and investment. “So, I think overall in these changing circumstances, Pakistan has played its cards right, and as you saw right after the attack on Doha, the Pakistan delegation was one of the first delegations to reach Doha and express our solidarity with the Qatari leadership. “So, I think Pakistan has not only played its cards right, but Pakistan has formulated a policy where we have had a lot of successes diplomatically. And this could not have been possible without the civil and military leadership being on the same page and without that cohesion and that ideal working relationship that exists between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir. “So, I think it’s also a result, a fruit of that cohesion and synergy that exists between institutions and it’s the stability at home which has enabled us to advocate our case very, very effectively abroad and we see that a lot of other countries are desirous of improving their relations with Pakistan.” US and China The information minister touched upon the burgeoning relations between Pakistan and the United States as well, with President Donald Trump’s frequent praise of PM Shehbaz and the army chief. “I think the way President Donald Trump has more than once praised Pakistan and praised the prime minister and the field marshal and mentioned those seven planes time and time again. So, you know, that’s a point to ponder upon. And we have had a great visit to the US. “Relations have improved immensely. And the recent visit to China. So, I think Pakistan’s relationship with each country has a unique nature. So, one relationship cannot be at the cost of another relationship. And I think that’s where the success of our foreign policy lies. And that’s how we plan to go into the future with a very, very robust, with a very effective and practical foreign policy which will not only give respect to Pakistan but which will also help us to take our economy to new heights so the life of an average Pakistani can also improve.“",
      "title": "‘Pakistan has become extremely relevant,’ Tarar says of foreign policy on global stage after May skirmish",
      "summary": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar on Monday said that Pakistan had become “extremely relevant” on the global stage after its performance during the military conflict against India in May. The conflict between the two countries in May this year was sparked by an attack on tourists in India-occupied Kashmir, which New Delhi, without evidence, linked to Pakistan. Islamabad strongly denied responsibility while calling for a neutral investigation . New Delhi then launched deadly air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7. After tit-for-tat strikes on each other’s airbases during the four-day escalation, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally reach a ceasefire. Both governments launched diplomatic blitzes after the conflict to take their stance on the ordeal to other countries. Elaborating on Pakistan’s image and standing in the world in the conflict’s aftermath while speaking at a function, the information minister said, “In a very short span of time, we have become extremely relevant in our foreign policy. We have seen in the past two years, and especially after the May war, I think that has redefined who we are.” He said the “turning point” after the Pahalgam incident was Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s open offer for an impartial and fair investigation because “we were often blamed for terror acts that were not our fault, and in fact, being the biggest victims of terrorism, there was a propaganda against Pakistan, blaming us for terrorism.” The information minister said that “you can’t be a victim and an aggressor at the same time — it’s an oxymoron, an inherent contradiction, it’s just not possible.” He said no other country could lay claim to the loss of 90,000 lives in the war against terrorism or billions in economic losses. “We are also a shield and a wall between the terrorists and the rest of the world,” Tarar added, saying that the sacrifice of any Pakistani was also for the sake of making the world a better place. The minister said the above sacrifices could not go in vain. “So, I think the time was right that the world heard our story and heard it right. By authoring this investigation just before the war, I think we had a point to prove that our hands were clean, and that point was well taken. “That turning point strengthened our fence, our alliances and countries that were on the fence; it made them realise what Pakistan stands for, and by authoring this investigation, Pakistan made a good diplomatic move which was well received the world over. I think after that, there was immense diplomatic engagement … and that constant engagement really helped us prove our point to the world. “So when I say the world was changing, Pakistan also changed; we saw an aggressive diplomatic change. Our diplomacy worked very well because we were taking it and relations with all countries very seriously. There was no laxity, and there was no room for any complacency, and we were right on the job,” the information minister said. He added that Pakistan did all it could on international media outlets. “We had the strength of the truth, so when we told the story and told it right, the world heard it, and it had an impact. So the right kind of aggressive diplomacy with the right kind of marketing campaign with the right kind of information to counter misinformation and disinformation — so we were everywhere all across,” he further said. National synergy and Gen Z Tarar also said he appreciated the “synergy” with the military’s spokesperson in putting out information, saying it would not have been possible otherwise. “So we were winning on the narrative front and the diplomatic front. When it actually came down to the brass tacks, we had already shot down seven planes and when we were confronted with brute force, we gave them a bloody noise and that befitting response proved our military might so … when it came down to the actual war, Pakistan passed with flying colours and, you know, within hours, actually within four hours, India was compelled to request for a ceasefire. “So, when I say Pakistan is changing, Pakistan actually changed. And I must acknowledge the kind of unity that we displayed as a nation. The resilience of our people, the people of Pakistan, came together, forgot our differences. I remember speaking on the floor of the house and saying that, you know, today, there is no critical point scoring, we are all on the same page, and we will fight the enemy together as a unified force, and that’s exactly what we did.” The information minister, in particular, singled out Gen Z and the use of social media and memes during the conflict. “When I say Pakistan has changed, you know, when it came down to the meme war and the enemy was stunned that our youngsters on social media had actually come up with memes in a very serious situation. And the enemy was wondering what is going on. War is a very serious matter, and they were making memes and they were ridiculing the enemy in their own particular way. “So, even our Gen Z, our younger generation, they played a role with regard to social media. And they took it upon themselves to fight for Pakistan on that platform, on that battlefield, because I often say that, you know, the digital world is divided into two kinds of people. You have digital natives and digital immigrants. “And sometimes the immigrants, you know, they take time to comprehend the ground realities of digital media. But people who are born into the digital age and they are digital natives, they understand that world much better than most of us do. So, I think the digital natives had their own war strategy and had their own way of winning that war.” Relevancy in global events Returning to his main point about Pakistan’s increased global relevance after the conflict, the minister pointed to the country’s involvement in the Gaza peace process. “If you see the way forward, Pakistan has become extremely relevant.

      "summary_orig": "A fatal accident involving a bus filled with Indian pilgrims killed at least 45 people near Saudi Arabia’s holy city of Madina, Indian police said on Monday, one of the deadliest crashes in the Gulf kingdom in years. “The tragic bus accident involving Indian pilgrims in Saudi Arabia is deeply distressing,” VC Sajjanar, police commissioner for the city of Hyderabad, where many of the Indian citizens were reported to have come from, told reporters. “According to preliminary information, 46 people were travelling in the bus at the time of the incident, and heartbreakingly, only one person survived,” he said. Saudi officials have not provided a toll for the crash. Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences in a post on social media, saying the Indian embassy was working with Saudi officials on the ground. “Deeply saddened by the accident in Medina involving Indian nationals. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones,” the prime minister wrote on X. “I pray for the swift recovery of all those injured. Our Embassy in Riyadh and consulate in Jeddah are providing all possible assistance,” he added. Road crashes were one of the greatest causes of injuries and fatalities in Saudi Arabia, according to a 2023 UN statement, which also said the kingdom had retained a high road fatality rate compared to other high-income countries. Transporting worshippers around Saudi Arabia’s holy sites has frequently proven dangerous, particularly during the Haj, when roads can be chaotic with buses creating interminable traffic jams. Millions also visit Saudi Arabia for the Umrah pilgrimage, which happens outside of the Haj period. In March 2023 , a bus ferrying pilgrims to the holy city of Mecca burst into flames after a collision on a bridge, killing 20 people and injuring more than two dozen others. And in October 2019 , some 35 foreigners were killed and four others injured when a bus collided with another heavy vehicle near Madina. Pilgrimages are an essential component of Saudi Arabia’s burgeoning tourism sector that officials hope will help diversify the kingdom’s economy away from fossil fuels. The Gulf kingdom is also home to more than two million Indian nationals who have long played a pivotal role in its labour market, helping construct many of the country’s mega-projects while sending billions of dollars in remittances back home each year. Saudi Arabia and India have fostered a close relationship for decades. India’s rapidly developing economy relies heavily on petroleum imports, with Saudi Arabia ranked as its third-largest supplier, according to the Indian foreign ministry.",

      "title_orig": "Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina: From political dominance to death sentence",
      "summary_orig": "Bangladesh’s Sheikh Hasina, sentenced to death in absentia on Monday for her deadly crackdown on student protesters last year, has been a dominant figure in the South Asian nation for half a century, a career rooted in bloodshed. Thrust into prominence with the assassination of her father, independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and much of her family in a military coup, Hasina early on fought for democracy, but her long reign as prime minister became marked by arrests of opposition leaders, crackdowns on free speech and suppression of dissent. She was found guilty of ordering lethal force by a tribunal in the capital Dhaka 15 months after resigning and fleeing to India in the face of a student-led uprising that killed hundreds or more. Students celebrate after the verdict on cases against ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on November 17, 2025. — Reuters Joined rival to seek democracy before feud Despite criticism of her years in power, Hasina, 78, was credited with turning around the economy and the massive garments industry of the Muslim-majority nation of 170 million, while winning international praise for sheltering Rohingya Muslims fleeing persecution in neighbouring Myanmar. But her downfall — she was ousted less than seven months after winning a fifth term as leader — was the protests that began over job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her removal. Hasina, from her exile in India, has denied the allegations against her, saying the verdict was “biased and politically motivated”. “I am not afraid to face my accusers in a proper tribunal where evidence can be weighed and tested fairly,” Hasina said in a statement after the verdict. Her state-appointed defence counsel told the court the charges were baseless. A UN report in February said up to 1,400 people may have been killed during the protests, most from gunfire by security forces, and cited evidence that it was official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters and sympathisers. The verdict by the International Crimes Tribunal — a court Hasina set up to try war crimes from Bangladesh’s 1971 war for independence from Pakistan — marks a dramatic turn for a political career that began when she avoided death during the 1975 coup because she happened to be in Europe. Born in 1947 in the southwest of the country, which was then East Pakistan, Hasina was the eldest of five children. After getting a degree in Bengali literature from Dhaka University in 1973, she gained political experience as a go-between for her father and his student followers. Exiled to India after the coup, she returned in 1981 and was elected head of the Awami League, Bangladesh’s oldest political party and a force in the struggle for independence. Hasina joined political foe Khaleda Zia, chief of the rival Bangladesh Nationalist Party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990. But the alliance did not last. The bitter rivalry between the two — called the “battling begums”, using an Urdu honorific for prominent women — went on to dominate Bangladeshi politics for decades. Hasina first led the Awami League to victory in 1996, serving a five-year term, then regained power in 2009, never to lose it again. A man holds a poster in front of the court demanding the capital punishment ahead of the verdict on charges of crimes against humanity for a deadly crackdown on student-led protests in 2024 against the ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, on November 17, 2025. — Reuters Claims of abuses, downfall, exile As time went on, critics said, she became increasingly autocratic and her rule was marked by mass arrests of political opponents and activists, forced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. Rights groups warned of a virtual one-party rule by the Awami League. Hasina defended her tenure as a period of stability and development, arguing that strong, uninterrupted leadership was needed to keep Bangladesh on track. Khaleda — herself a former prime minister and the widow of an assassinated former president — was jailed in 2018 on graft charges that her party said had been trumped up. She was freed after Hasina’s ouster. Hasina and Khaleda accused each other of trying to create chaos and violence to jeopardise a democracy that had yet to take firm root in Bangladesh. The once-racing economy has slowed sharply since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine pushed up prices of imported fuel and food, forcing Bangladesh to turn last year to the International Monetary Fund for a $4.7 billion bailout. After Hasina fled the uprising in August last year with her sister on a military helicopter, jubilant crowds stormed unopposed into the opulent presidential residence, carrying out looted furniture and televisions. Since then, Bangladesh has been governed by an interim administration headed by Nobel Peace laureate Muhammad Yunus — a figure Hasina had attacked for years, who was convicted of graft under her government. Her Awami League is barred from contesting parliamentary elections to be held in early February.

      "summary_orig": "Information Attaullah Tarar took notice after journalist Benazir Shah said that an account he followed on the social media platform X had made an AI-generated video of her. He asserted that nobody had the right to make “fake videos” or try to harass journalists by defaming them. Shah posted on Sunday on X that an account on the social media platform followed by Tarar had “made an AI video of me”. “But as we’ve said before, we’ll say it again: #AttacksWontSilenceUS ,” she added. Her post was in response to the video in question, shared by an account called PakVocals. The description with the clip claimed that it was a “leaked video” of Shah “dancing in a club in London”. Subsequently, Tarar responded to Shah on Sunday night, saying, “Totally unacceptable and highly condemnable. Notice taken, please. “Nobody has the right to make fake videos and then disseminate them or try to harass any journalist by defaming them. I follow more than 1,900 accounts. I do not condone the behaviour of this account and also assure you that action will be taken,” the minister said. Later, Shah said she appreciated the minister taking the matter seriously. However, she said that she did not want to pursue a case under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) through the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) as “doing so would lend legitimacy to a law and an institution that have been used to harass journalists, silence private citizens, and suppress dissent”. “If the minister and his government are serious about ensuring safety for journalists and citizens, they should scrap Peca and the NCCIA and begin a genuine consultation process to draft legislation that truly addresses journalists’ concerns,” she said. Journalists also rallied behind Shah as the matter garnered attention on social media. “Deep fake, condemnable, culpable crime, should be investigated and the one who doctored the video must be brought to the court of law. My sincere support to fellow brilliant journalist Benazir Shah who always stands by facts, neutrality and truth. More power to you. Stand firm, please,” posted journalist Zahid Gishkori on X. Journalist Asad Ali Toor said he was sure that the person in the video was not Shah. He said he was also certain that the account that shared the video was a “pro PML-N account followed by pro PML-N journalists and the minister”. “This is [a] shameful and disgusting campaign, and I strongly condemn it. At the same time, I want to say all political parties have their own pool of dirt which they time to time launch against their critics. Shameful,” he commented. Journalist Meher Bokhari, referring to the video in question and the accosting of Geo News anchor Shahzeb Khanzada in a separate incident, called for more respect. “This is not who we were meant to become. Whether it’s PTI supporters harassing Shazeb Khanzada or or PML-N supporters circulating fake AI videos of Benazir Shah, none of it reflects who we are. “Both are hardworking journalists, people who have dedicated their lives to informing the public despite constant pressure. Sure, nothing makes sense here anymore, but the least we can do is hold on to our values and our respect for one another. Character is what you choose to keep intact when everything around you falls apart,” she said.",

      "summary_orig": "Health Minister Mustafa Kamal expressed confidence on Monday that the changes pertaining local governments sought by the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) would be addressed in the next constitutional amendment slated for the “coming months”. Kamal made the remarks while addressing a press conference in Karachi, less than a week after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law amid protests by the opposition and other quarters. When the 27th Amendment was tabled in the National Assembly on Nov 11, Kamal had referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of the 28th Amendment. Speaking to the media today, he said that changes were initially pitched to be included in the 26th Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year. Kamal then thanked other parties, including the ruling PML-N, and “individual friends from the PPP” and “many friends from the PTI” for “vocally backing” the MQM-P’s changes related to local governments. He said the proposed changes were extensively discussed for over six hours in the parliamentary standing committee meeting called to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment. “We had enough numbers […] We had won our case in the standing committee. We had the numbers. We had the support of the PML-N and others,” he maintained. “But the PPP was not ready to support the [inclusion of] our bill [on local governments] in the 27th Amendment, which resulted in a deadlock,” he added, clarifying that he was not making any allegations in saying so. Kamal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the ruling PML-N then requested the MQM-P to postpone its proposed changes once again as the 27th Amendment included crucial provisions pertaining to the Pakistan Army and the judiciary. “We were assured that they all supported the bill. They asked for one more chance, assuring that this would be included in the next amendment,” he added. Subsequently, the MQM-P decided to accept the request in the “larger interest of the country,” he said. Stressing the importance of changes pertaining to local government, Kamal further stated: “In Pakistan, […] in the coming months, this constitutional amendment will be introduced in the assembly and get approved, and the people will get resources at their doorstep.” Kamal also referred to the Punjab As­­sembly unanimously passing a resolution last month, calling for an amendment to Article 140-A of the Constitution to ensu­­re empowerment and protection of local bodies, along with mandatory and timely elections for effective governance. He deemed the development a success of the MQM-P. Kamal’s remarks come a day after Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if the need was felt to “maintain stability” in the country.",

Kamal made the remarks while addressing a press conference in Karachi, less than a week after the contentious 27th Constitutional Amendment was enacted into law amid protests by the opposition and other quarters. When the 27th Amendment was tabled in the National Assembly on Nov 11, Kamal had referred to Article 140-A of the Constitution, which relates to local governments, and said his party’s proposed amendments “are not dead yet” and would be discussed as part of the 28th Amendment. Speaking to the media today, he said that changes were initially pitched to be included in the 26th Amendment, which was passed by Parliament during an overnight session in October last year. Kamal then thanked other parties, including the ruling PML-N, and “individual friends from the PPP” and “many friends from the PTI” for “vocally backing” the MQM-P’s changes related to local governments. He said the proposed changes were extensively discussed for over six hours in the parliamentary standing committee meeting called to deliberate on the 27th Constitutional Amendment. “We had enough numbers […] We had won our case in the standing committee. We had the numbers. We had the support of the PML-N and others,” he maintained. “But the PPP was not ready to support the [inclusion of] our bill [on local governments] in the 27th Amendment, which resulted in a deadlock,” he added, clarifying that he was not making any allegations in saying so. Kamal said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the ruling PML-N then requested the MQM-P to postpone its proposed changes once again as the 27th Amendment included crucial provisions pertaining to the Pakistan Army and the judiciary. “We were assured that they all supported the bill. They asked for one more chance, assuring that this would be included in the next amendment,” he added. Subsequently, the MQM-P decided to accept the request in the “larger interest of the country,” he said. Stressing the importance of changes pertaining to local government, Kamal further stated: “In Pakistan, […] in the coming months, this constitutional amendment will be introduced in the assembly and get approved, and the people will get resources at their doorstep.” Kamal also referred to the Punjab As­­sembly unanimously passing a resolution last month, calling for an amendment to Article 140-A of the Constitution to ensu­­re empowerment and protection of local bodies, along with mandatory and timely elections for effective governance. He deemed the development a success of the MQM-P. Kamal’s remarks come a day after Minister of State for Interior Tallal Chaudhry said the ruling coalition could introduce another constitutional amendment if the need was felt to “maintain stability” in the country.",

      "summary_orig": "Politicians and journalists have jumped to the defence of anchorperson Shahzeb Khanzada after videos emerged on social media of him being accosted in public by a man accusing him of acting against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away. While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period. “This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist. The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”. Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”. “This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister. PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident. “You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said. Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”. “When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said. Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”. “This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai. “Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said. Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada. “I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him. Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable. “There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said. Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time. “This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani. “Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said. “I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi. The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”. “Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said. Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying. “This is classic Shahbaz Gill. When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings. “These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said. “We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said. The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections. In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.",

When he was a minister, he was caught lying several times and here again he is lying,” he said, adding that he was responsible for reporting court proceedings. “These trolls actually don’t care about facts even if they go in favour of Imran Khan,” he said. “We didn’t just expose the Iddat case but also spoke for Shahbaz Gill, condemned his torture under custody and the use of the outdated treason law against him even when his own party and leaders were refusing to speak for him,” he said. The PTI founder and his wife — who are both currently under arrest — were convicted by an Islamabad court in the Iddat case and sentenced to seven years in jail each on Feb 3, 2024, five days before the general elections. In July the same year, they were acquitted in the case but then arrested on charges related to the sale of state gifts.",
      "title": "Politicians, journalists jump to Shahzeb Khanzada’s defence after anchorperson accosted in public",
      "summary": "Politicians and journalists have jumped to the defence of anchorperson Shahzeb Khanzada after videos emerged on social media of him being accosted in public by a man accusing him of acting against PTI founder Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi. The video, which has been circulating on social media since Sunday night, shows a man following Khanzada in what appeared to be a clothing store. In the video, the man told the journalist he should be “ashamed” of “what he has done against Imran” and his wife. For his part, Khanzada — who appeared to be present with his family — did not engage with the man and walked away. While the man did not provide an explanation for the allegations he was levelling against the journalist, PTI’s Shahbaz Gill shared an old clip of Khanzada talking about the Iddat case, filed against Bushra Bibi and Imran by her former husband Khawar Maneka, on his show. The case pertains to Imran and Bushra Bibi’s marriage during the latter’s Iddat period. “This is the filth Shahzeb did,” he said. He added that if the condemnation had come from the media fraternity, then the situation would not have reached this point, an apparent reference to the harassment of the journalist. The incident comes two days after The Economist published an article covering Imran’s marriage to Bushra Bibi and her alleged role and extent of influence in his decision-making during his tenure as premier, which the party has termed recycled propaganda masquerading as foreign commentary. Many on social media came to Khanzada’s defence, terming the incident “condemnable”. Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the incident was “yet another filthy reminder of the mob mentality Imran Khan has carefully bred within PTI”. “This crowd does not [have] manners, they were never taught dignity, decency or basic humanity. Their entire existence feeds on confrontation, chaos, and bullying. This is not politics, it is brute thuggery masquerading as activism. They know that they can only survive when society is torn down,” said the minister. PPP leader and Sindh Minister for Local Government Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said he strongly condemned the incident. “You can certainly disagree, but do so within the bounds of decency and respect. Your actions have not affected Shahzeb Khanzada’s honour, but rather [of] those who taught you this behaviour,” he said. Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) Senator Faisal Subzwari said the incident was “another glimpse into the filth that had taken root in politics over the past decade”. “When national leaders praise the abuse brigade and give bad names to everyone except their own kind, then these lamentable traditions take root,” he said. Journalist Waseem Abbasi called the incident harassment, adding that this was “no crusade”. “This is disgusting and utterly condemnable,” said Ziauddin Yousafzai, the father of Nobel Laureate Malala Yousufzai. “Khanzada is an honourable man and an outstanding journalist. This incident exposes the ugly face and behaviour of an intolerant cult,” he said. Journalist Asad Ali Toor termed the incident a “shameful campaign” against Khanzada. “I still maintain that Shahzeb in that interview completely exposed Khawar Maneka that his ‘Iddat’ case is a politically motivated case and he is just a disgusting proxy,” he said, adding that the PTI should be thanking him, rather than harassing him. Journalist Matiullah Jan said that Imran’s supporters should learn that harassing a journalist in this manner in the presence of his family members was condemnable. “There are a hundred civilised ways of protesting. Shahzeb Khanzada has left the government and its ministers speechless on many occasions,” he said. Journalist Zahid Gishkori, who has previously worked with Khanzada, said it was “extremely painful to see a strange man” harassing the latter and his family, adding that he stood with the journalist during this difficult time. “This is unacceptable and outright shameful. Harassing someone in a public place is not freedom of expression, it’s intimidation and thuggery,” said sports journalist Faizan Lakhani. “Shahzeb Khanzada is a respected, credible journalist, and this behaviour towards him is shameful. This incident exposes the true face of an intolerant society,” he said. “I strongly condemn the worst kind of fascism and the targeted harassment being inflicted on Shahzeb Khanzada by zombies of a political party,” said journalist Asma Shirazi. The Pakistan Daily founder Hamza Azhar Salam said the PTI had not taken Khanzada to court for defamation because “it knows they will be taken to the cleaners”. “Instead, PTI workers unleashed to harass Pakistan’s most credible journalist in front of his family. We stand by Khanzada and condemn this campaign of harassment,” he said. Meanwhile, Khanzada responded to PTI leader Gill on X, accusing him of lying. “This is classic Shahbaz Gill.

      "title_orig": "WHAT I HAVE LEARNT IN 50 YEARS",
      "summary_orig": "Over the last 50-plus years, I have sat through numerous presentations on government, NGO, masters and PhD students’ development projects, in various countries, both in what is now known as the global North and global South. In addition, international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, have also sought my assistance. I have also been a member of various United Nations committees on physical and social development, and a consultant to them. As the chief adviser and the chairperson of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) and the Urban Resource Centre (URC), I have challenged the structure of thinking of many such projects and documented my concerns regularly. The most important thing I have learned in the process is that most of these projects have a very strong anti-poor bias and are primarily concerned with brick and mortar aspects of problems. ANTI-POOR BIAS As far as academia is concerned, almost all teachers and supervisors bring their class prejudices with them, and the literature search that students have to undertake strengthens these prejudices. The poor are portrayed as helpless and incapable of taking decisions regarding their own lives. The students are asked to observe and pass judgements on their observations. The poor are almost never asked their own definition of poverty. Judgements are passed in surveys on the basis of very small numbers. And once these numbers are cited, they become the “truth” for other students and consultants to follow. Planning and development expert Arif Hasan has spent more than five decades working with poor communities across Pakistan and development practitioners and institutes around the world. He reflects on the major lessons he has learnt from that experience and his personal observations on what is wrong with Pakistan’s development paradigm… In addition, studies by IFIs have an interest in portraying conditions to be much worse than they really are, so as to increase their loan packages for the project or policy under consideration. In addition, much of the loans Pakistan takes are for paying off previous loans, something that is seldom taken into consideration by the authors of the plans. DOUBLE STANDARDS The anti-poor bias expresses itself in other ways as well. Building standards developed for poor and rich settlements vary considerably. The poor settlements have much lower standards, the contractor is badly supervised, and the element of corruption is much higher in percentage terms. Much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed for them collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, low-income settlements are completely flooded. It is not of much satisfaction that middle-income settlements today suffer the same fate as well. Even the workmen employed for the low-income settlement projects are not skilled, paid less per day, and the savings that are generated are taken over for politicians, bureaucrats and the contractor himself. Many decisions that are taken for low-income settlements are a violation of common sense. Much of the professionals employed on these projects are barely trained, and many do not possess a qualification and are seldom present on site. HEALTH Health is a major issue in low-income settlements. Disease deprives a family of income and, to get well, one has to spend money, which the family cannot afford. The location of hospitals or medical facilities are not where they are needed, but in locations where amenity plots had been located in formal and informal planning. In addition, in academic training, a lot of emphasis is put on curative rather than preventive medicine. That determines the location and design of health-related infrastructure, and the relation between disease and architecture simply does not exist in planning concepts. The cost of curative medicine has become so high that many families are now heavily in debt because of it. Surveys show that people have shifted to hakeems [traditional healers] and homeopathic systems, so as to make medicine affordable. PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS If you look at the location of parks and playgrounds, the main municipal parks are eight to 10 km away from most low-income settlements. Amenity plots in low-income settlements have been encroached upon, and those that have not been encroached upon have not been developed. Many of them have become garbage dumps and sorting yards for solid waste, promoting disease and environmental degradation of the settlements around them. There are other aspects as well. Surveys by my office and the URC show that the poor are clear in their view that the major cause of their poverty is the absence of a roof that they own. A roof gives them dignity, the possibility of upward mobility, better proposals for their daughters’ marriages, the possibility of improving their home incrementally as and when they have money, freedom from insecurity, the possibility of their children — especially girls — receiving an education because of the savings made on rent and, subsequently, better jobs for their women, such as in malls and as supervisors in factories. These very important issues seldom form part of the housing analysis. Perhaps this is because these intangible issues do not help in justifying a large loan. AND WHAT ABOUT THE LOANS? A study of loans taken by Pakistan for housing purposes shows that, while the brick and mortar part is utilised, the intangible aspects are normally not utilised. Much of this is because sociologists who can make the necessary studies for the IFIs are very short in supply, and are usually employed as consultants. It is also because it is not easy to save money for illegal benefits from social infrastructure projects. Every loan has an element of capacity-building for the government staff and the special staff that is hired. This capacity-building usually consists of workshops and visits to foreign countries to see how projects in those countries were designed and how they function. They are usually independent projects, not necessarily a part of a larger policy. This capacity-building component is normally 12 percent  of the project cost. Over the years, millions of dollars have been invested in capacity-building. In spite of this, we keep building the same capacity again and again, and the departments for whom capacity is built revert back to their previous organisational culture and manner of functioning. We can see from the state in which the development agencies are, that no capacity has been built. EVICTIONS AND RESETTLEMENTS In housing projects, one of the main problems is acquiring land for them. This is done by removing existing settlements and relocating them, sometimes on the same land and very often elsewhere, on land identified and provided by the state. The new settlement, which was previously in the city centre, is relocated to the city’s fringes. This impoverishes the people and destroys community ties. It adds transport costs to work and back, deprives women of jobs because of distances and the costs involved from home to work and back, and it puts households in debt (since the poor pay monthly for their groceries, which was possible previously because of community links). Poor households also borrow from each other in times of need, which becomes difficult with new neighbours. The old manner of professionals and their support staff visiting settlements for long periods and spending time with the affectees of evictions is gone. And where it takes place it is like “development tourism.” As a result, there is little empathy between the different actors of development planning and the opinion of the affectees is usually missing, except for a paragraph or two summarised from a visit or survey. In addition, previously people formed committees and stood up for themselves and negotiated or demonstrated with their representatives and other influential personalities. Today, there is no lack of NGOs to support them or to initiate their struggle. This weakens their position as compared to before, as NGOs’ positions are more understanding and supportive of government decisions, as compared to people’s committees. Boys cross a makeshift 'bridge' at Karachi's Gujjar Nullah: much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed in  low-income settlements collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, these localities become completely flooded | Amar Guriro LAND AND HOUSING There are other issues with land as well. Government agencies claim that they have no land for development for the poor. Yet they have no problem handing out large land parcels to formal sector developers. There are many reasons for this. The state collects large revenues from the sale and or development of these land parcels. The fact that poor cooperatives can produce the same revenue over a longer period of time, with interest, is disregarded. Then there is another problem. Available land, which is next to expensive land and that can be considered for low-income groups, is not considered because the value of the expensive land will fall if it is next to low-income settlements. As a result, the poor can only live on peripheral or environmentally degraded land that no one wants. The market, realising the demand for low-income housing near the city centre, has found ways to cater to this demand. Old katchi abadis [informal settlements] near the centre are being converted into multi-storey apartments, often four to seven floors high. They have no lifts and very narrow streets. When they began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they provided cheap flats for the lower-middle class to purchase on cash, instalments or pagrri [goodwill money]. Today, they are not affordable, even for the better-off poor. The result is that an increasing number of flat-owners are in debt, from purchasing and continuing to live in these highrises. These new developments are not considered legal by state agencies, as they follow no by-laws and zoning regulations, simply because such regulations do not exist. The residents, therefore, live in a constant fear of eviction. But the informal sector has devised documents of sale and possession amongst themselves. Their legality is decided on the basis of by-laws which are applied to formally constructed houses. This is very unfair because these houses have no lease and they have never applied for a building permit — this concept did not exist when they began construction. In addition, government surveys of informal settlements for rehabilitation purposes are also faulty. These surveys usually count houses as they appear on a Google map. However, in informal settlements, many households often live on one plot of land or in one house. So, government surveys are usually about houses and not about people. Thus, government figures are unreliable and the cause of considerable injustice. COMPENSATIONS Compensation given as money is usually more equitable, as the affectee can use it at their convenience. Yet it has to be sufficient to rent accommodation or purchase a plot. It never is, because the needs of the poor are always under-estimated because of the bias against them, in the name of transparency. The manner in which money is given is complex. The affectee is viewed with suspicion by officialdom. So, something that could take a few hours gets lost in bureaucratic complexity, with many steps to take and many days in taking them. Because of this, affectees often lose day wages or have problems with their employers. A major problem is encountered by senior residents who are invalid and cannot afford to purchase or hire a home. So, many of them end up living on the street or under bridges. At night, many parks are also full of them but, as government attempts to prevent them from sleeping in parks improve, the number of people sleeping on the street or under bridges also increases. An increasingly large number are also sleeping on the beach. Conditions in the rural areas are also becoming increasingly difficult because of the need for cash, which daily wage labour can not manage to earn sufficiently. With climate change, the number of environmental refugees is also increasing rapidly. There are no plans to provide them jobs or spaces to live. They are also living on the streets, under bridges, or in under-construction buildings. They manage to earn somewhat because another informal sector provides them with trinkets, such as balloons, to sell. A whole supply-chain of manufacturing exists, providing these items on credit. The women clean car windscreens at crossroads. I have never found out what exactly their men do or what the number of such a population is. There are also street hotels on pavements that rent out a bed and breakfast for between Rs100 to 300 per night, along with some basic toilet facilities, which are often provided by the neighbouring mosque in lieu of a small donation by the user. These ‘hotels’ are also adjacent to transport terminals, where drinking water is publicly available. This is a whole unexplored world. A group of schoolgirls crossing a street in Rawalpindi: because the government schooling system is substandard, many families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which proves to be a great financial burden for poorer families | White Star DENSITY A serious issue that is evolving is related to density. One-hundred-and-twenty square yard plots (which were owned by the father or grandfather) are divided among the children. Every child wants his/her part to have access to the road, which divides the plot, often into 3, making the divided plot no more than 30 feet at the roadside. This means that each person gets no more than a 10-foot frontage. A first floor is sometimes added to this. So, where one family was living, now at least six families are living in a plot of very small frontage. This creates a situation of unbearable density and, as the population grows, there are further divisions and subdivisions and/ or high rises, which manage to create densities over 1,000 to 1,200 persons per hectare. This issue is seldom or never addressed. GROWING INEQUALITY GAP As a result of what has been discussed above, there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. That is why better-income young men and women stand a better chance in becoming members of national cultural and sports teams. The poor also complain of elite schools and colleges using their social and political influence in getting their members to become members of national teams. It is for all these reasons that the upper echelons of the judiciary, bureaucracy, business and the military are drawn from the elite private schools and universities of Pakistan and support each other on a class basis. Their development decisions support their class interests, and they are not fully aware of the problems that their country and its less fortunate citizens face. Development for them means bringing the benefits they have to the people of Pakistan. But this is not possible. IFIs have a major say in the development model of Pakistan. Their air-conditioned offices in the city centre, far away from the homes of low-income groups, their fleet of expensive cars, constant trips abroad, workshops in five-star hotels and huge salaries anger the people, and it is not uncommon to hear them say “they are becoming rich on our problems.” EDUCATION Education is one of the priorities of poor families. However, the government schooling system is poor, and so poor families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which are operated by local entrepreneurs. These are expensive as a result, so families have to decide which child to send to school and which child to send to work. This is a very difficult decision and causes ruptures in the family. Unlike neighbourhood schools, colleges and universities are very far away from low-income settlements, and a trip to them (in the absence of efficient and cheap transportation) and back is very expensive in terms of money and time. This also results in many young people giving up on higher education. This adversity affects the majority of women aspirants. All this is in addition to very high fees (often in tens of thousands), which low-income groups can seldom afford. CULTURE The Pakistan state is anti-culture and against students organising themselves. As a result, there is no student political activity. It is frowned upon, if not persecuted, and arts, music, dance and drama are discouraged. But all this has become an exclusive part of elite culture and held in elite institutions, often supported by cultural institutions of foreign countries. However, there are signs that this is changing and that the lower-middle class is slowly becoming a part of this. There was a time when student cards could subsidise travel, hostel charges, student canteens and library fees. All this has gone due to the neoliberal economic policies adopted by the state. Not only this, but every student who is admitted to a university signs a form saying he or she will not indulge in any form of discussion or debate regarding politics or religion. With this statement, dissent, which is a basic requirement of development and progress, is killed. WOMEN AND FAMILY STRUCTURES In the last 20 years, the family structure and the women of Karachi have changed. We have moved from joint to nuclear families. As a result, women have become comparatively independent and also dominate the fields of education and health. Self-willed marriages are increasing rapidly, and so is divorce. The conservative segment of society feels this is because people do not follow their religion. But this cannot be stopped. There is now a women’s football team, cricket team and hockey team, and women participate in athletics and martial arts and win. They participate in politics and participate in demonstrations, and often arrange them. Their public presence has increased too, and many women are in important government and private sector jobs as heads of institutions as well. But in spite of fairly strong women’s movements, women complain that they still have a long way to go before they can use their independence to achieve some form of equality with their men. They earn, but still they have to cook and clean. These changes have had a major impact on the design, especially on the incremental development, of the home and the future culture of the younger generation. Most homes possess a smartphone and have access to the internet and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, in spite of these developments, the city has almost no toilets for women, which restricts their working hours, and during their periods, they often have no option but to take the day off. In addition, the pavements that are available to them to walk on have obstructions such as trees, advertisement signage and broken patches. Often there are no pavements at all. This results in accidents and difficulty in moving around, especially with children and with senior citizens. There are many newly built roads that have no pavements at all and, when I have expressed this observation, I have been told “Arif Bhai, have you ever seen anyone walk on a pavement in Karachi?” FINAL NOTE There is much more that I have observed and written about and can safely conclude that, unless these and many other things are taken into account when trying to solve our problems and building a future, our problems will not be solved. Streets will flood, additional katchi abadis will be created, transport will not improve because it will not be maintained and managed, traffic will become more unbearable in the absence of management and, worst of all, women’s development will take place in an environment full of conflicts because the state will not support it. Hopefully, a new generation that is now growing up will be able to change this. The writer is an architect and urban planner.

      "title_en": "WHAT I HAVE LEARNT IN 50 YEARS",
      "summary_en": "Over the last 50-plus years, I have sat through numerous presentations on government, NGO, masters and PhD students’ development projects, in various countries, both in what is now known as the global North and global South. In addition, international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, have also sought my assistance. I have also been a member of various United Nations committees on physical and social development, and a consultant to them. As the chief adviser and the chairperson of the Orangi Pilot Project (OPP) and the Urban Resource Centre (URC), I have challenged the structure of thinking of many such projects and documented my concerns regularly. The most important thing I have learned in the process is that most of these projects have a very strong anti-poor bias and are primarily concerned with brick and mortar aspects of problems. ANTI-POOR BIAS As far as academia is concerned, almost all teachers and supervisors bring their class prejudices with them, and the literature search that students have to undertake strengthens these prejudices. The poor are portrayed as helpless and incapable of taking decisions regarding their own lives. The students are asked to observe and pass judgements on their observations. The poor are almost never asked their own definition of poverty. Judgements are passed in surveys on the basis of very small numbers. And once these numbers are cited, they become the “truth” for other students and consultants to follow. Planning and development expert Arif Hasan has spent more than five decades working with poor communities across Pakistan and development practitioners and institutes around the world. He reflects on the major lessons he has learnt from that experience and his personal observations on what is wrong with Pakistan’s development paradigm… In addition, studies by IFIs have an interest in portraying conditions to be much worse than they really are, so as to increase their loan packages for the project or policy under consideration. In addition, much of the loans Pakistan takes are for paying off previous loans, something that is seldom taken into consideration by the authors of the plans. DOUBLE STANDARDS The anti-poor bias expresses itself in other ways as well. Building standards developed for poor and rich settlements vary considerably. The poor settlements have much lower standards, the contractor is badly supervised, and the element of corruption is much higher in percentage terms. Much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed for them collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, low-income settlements are completely flooded. It is not of much satisfaction that middle-income settlements today suffer the same fate as well. Even the workmen employed for the low-income settlement projects are not skilled, paid less per day, and the savings that are generated are taken over for politicians, bureaucrats and the contractor himself. Many decisions that are taken for low-income settlements are a violation of common sense. Much of the professionals employed on these projects are barely trained, and many do not possess a qualification and are seldom present on site. HEALTH Health is a major issue in low-income settlements. Disease deprives a family of income and, to get well, one has to spend money, which the family cannot afford. The location of hospitals or medical facilities are not where they are needed, but in locations where amenity plots had been located in formal and informal planning. In addition, in academic training, a lot of emphasis is put on curative rather than preventive medicine. That determines the location and design of health-related infrastructure, and the relation between disease and architecture simply does not exist in planning concepts. The cost of curative medicine has become so high that many families are now heavily in debt because of it. Surveys show that people have shifted to hakeems [traditional healers] and homeopathic systems, so as to make medicine affordable. PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS If you look at the location of parks and playgrounds, the main municipal parks are eight to 10 km away from most low-income settlements. Amenity plots in low-income settlements have been encroached upon, and those that have not been encroached upon have not been developed. Many of them have become garbage dumps and sorting yards for solid waste, promoting disease and environmental degradation of the settlements around them. There are other aspects as well. Surveys by my office and the URC show that the poor are clear in their view that the major cause of their poverty is the absence of a roof that they own. A roof gives them dignity, the possibility of upward mobility, better proposals for their daughters’ marriages, the possibility of improving their home incrementally as and when they have money, freedom from insecurity, the possibility of their children — especially girls — receiving an education because of the savings made on rent and, subsequently, better jobs for their women, such as in malls and as supervisors in factories. These very important issues seldom form part of the housing analysis. Perhaps this is because these intangible issues do not help in justifying a large loan. AND WHAT ABOUT THE LOANS? A study of loans taken by Pakistan for housing purposes shows that, while the brick and mortar part is utilised, the intangible aspects are normally not utilised. Much of this is because sociologists who can make the necessary studies for the IFIs are very short in supply, and are usually employed as consultants. It is also because it is not easy to save money for illegal benefits from social infrastructure projects. Every loan has an element of capacity-building for the government staff and the special staff that is hired. This capacity-building usually consists of workshops and visits to foreign countries to see how projects in those countries were designed and how they function. They are usually independent projects, not necessarily a part of a larger policy. This capacity-building component is normally 12 percent  of the project cost. Over the years, millions of dollars have been invested in capacity-building. In spite of this, we keep building the same capacity again and again, and the departments for whom capacity is built revert back to their previous organisational culture and manner of functioning. We can see from the state in which the development agencies are, that no capacity has been built. EVICTIONS AND RESETTLEMENTS In housing projects, one of the main problems is acquiring land for them. This is done by removing existing settlements and relocating them, sometimes on the same land and very often elsewhere, on land identified and provided by the state. The new settlement, which was previously in the city centre, is relocated to the city’s fringes. This impoverishes the people and destroys community ties. It adds transport costs to work and back, deprives women of jobs because of distances and the costs involved from home to work and back, and it puts households in debt (since the poor pay monthly for their groceries, which was possible previously because of community links). Poor households also borrow from each other in times of need, which becomes difficult with new neighbours. The old manner of professionals and their support staff visiting settlements for long periods and spending time with the affectees of evictions is gone. And where it takes place it is like “development tourism.” As a result, there is little empathy between the different actors of development planning and the opinion of the affectees is usually missing, except for a paragraph or two summarised from a visit or survey. In addition, previously people formed committees and stood up for themselves and negotiated or demonstrated with their representatives and other influential personalities. Today, there is no lack of NGOs to support them or to initiate their struggle. This weakens their position as compared to before, as NGOs’ positions are more understanding and supportive of government decisions, as compared to people’s committees. Boys cross a makeshift 'bridge' at Karachi's Gujjar Nullah: much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed in  low-income settlements collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, these localities become completely flooded | Amar Guriro LAND AND HOUSING There are other issues with land as well.

And where it takes place it is like “development tourism.” As a result, there is little empathy between the different actors of development planning and the opinion of the affectees is usually missing, except for a paragraph or two summarised from a visit or survey. In addition, previously people formed committees and stood up for themselves and negotiated or demonstrated with their representatives and other influential personalities. Today, there is no lack of NGOs to support them or to initiate their struggle. This weakens their position as compared to before, as NGOs’ positions are more understanding and supportive of government decisions, as compared to people’s committees. Boys cross a makeshift 'bridge' at Karachi's Gujjar Nullah: much of the roads, sewage trunks and water pipes constructed in  low-income settlements collapse in a short period of time and, in the absence of well-planned drainage, these localities become completely flooded | Amar Guriro LAND AND HOUSING There are other issues with land as well. Government agencies claim that they have no land for development for the poor. Yet they have no problem handing out large land parcels to formal sector developers. There are many reasons for this. The state collects large revenues from the sale and or development of these land parcels. The fact that poor cooperatives can produce the same revenue over a longer period of time, with interest, is disregarded. Then there is another problem. Available land, which is next to expensive land and that can be considered for low-income groups, is not considered because the value of the expensive land will fall if it is next to low-income settlements. As a result, the poor can only live on peripheral or environmentally degraded land that no one wants. The market, realising the demand for low-income housing near the city centre, has found ways to cater to this demand. Old katchi abadis [informal settlements] near the centre are being converted into multi-storey apartments, often four to seven floors high. They have no lifts and very narrow streets. When they began in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they provided cheap flats for the lower-middle class to purchase on cash, instalments or pagrri [goodwill money]. Today, they are not affordable, even for the better-off poor. The result is that an increasing number of flat-owners are in debt, from purchasing and continuing to live in these highrises. These new developments are not considered legal by state agencies, as they follow no by-laws and zoning regulations, simply because such regulations do not exist. The residents, therefore, live in a constant fear of eviction. But the informal sector has devised documents of sale and possession amongst themselves. Their legality is decided on the basis of by-laws which are applied to formally constructed houses. This is very unfair because these houses have no lease and they have never applied for a building permit — this concept did not exist when they began construction. In addition, government surveys of informal settlements for rehabilitation purposes are also faulty. These surveys usually count houses as they appear on a Google map. However, in informal settlements, many households often live on one plot of land or in one house. So, government surveys are usually about houses and not about people. Thus, government figures are unreliable and the cause of considerable injustice. COMPENSATIONS Compensation given as money is usually more equitable, as the affectee can use it at their convenience. Yet it has to be sufficient to rent accommodation or purchase a plot. It never is, because the needs of the poor are always under-estimated because of the bias against them, in the name of transparency. The manner in which money is given is complex. The affectee is viewed with suspicion by officialdom. So, something that could take a few hours gets lost in bureaucratic complexity, with many steps to take and many days in taking them. Because of this, affectees often lose day wages or have problems with their employers. A major problem is encountered by senior residents who are invalid and cannot afford to purchase or hire a home. So, many of them end up living on the street or under bridges. At night, many parks are also full of them but, as government attempts to prevent them from sleeping in parks improve, the number of people sleeping on the street or under bridges also increases. An increasingly large number are also sleeping on the beach. Conditions in the rural areas are also becoming increasingly difficult because of the need for cash, which daily wage labour can not manage to earn sufficiently. With climate change, the number of environmental refugees is also increasing rapidly. There are no plans to provide them jobs or spaces to live. They are also living on the streets, under bridges, or in under-construction buildings. They manage to earn somewhat because another informal sector provides them with trinkets, such as balloons, to sell. A whole supply-chain of manufacturing exists, providing these items on credit. The women clean car windscreens at crossroads. I have never found out what exactly their men do or what the number of such a population is. There are also street hotels on pavements that rent out a bed and breakfast for between Rs100 to 300 per night, along with some basic toilet facilities, which are often provided by the neighbouring mosque in lieu of a small donation by the user. These ‘hotels’ are also adjacent to transport terminals, where drinking water is publicly available. This is a whole unexplored world. A group of schoolgirls crossing a street in Rawalpindi: because the government schooling system is substandard, many families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which proves to be a great financial burden for poorer families | White Star DENSITY A serious issue that is evolving is related to density. One-hundred-and-twenty square yard plots (which were owned by the father or grandfather) are divided among the children. Every child wants his/her part to have access to the road, which divides the plot, often into 3, making the divided plot no more than 30 feet at the roadside. This means that each person gets no more than a 10-foot frontage. A first floor is sometimes added to this. So, where one family was living, now at least six families are living in a plot of very small frontage. This creates a situation of unbearable density and, as the population grows, there are further divisions and subdivisions and/ or high rises, which manage to create densities over 1,000 to 1,200 persons per hectare. This issue is seldom or never addressed. GROWING INEQUALITY GAP As a result of what has been discussed above, there is a growing gap between the rich and the poor. That is why better-income young men and women stand a better chance in becoming members of national cultural and sports teams. The poor also complain of elite schools and colleges using their social and political influence in getting their members to become members of national teams. It is for all these reasons that the upper echelons of the judiciary, bureaucracy, business and the military are drawn from the elite private schools and universities of Pakistan and support each other on a class basis. Their development decisions support their class interests, and they are not fully aware of the problems that their country and its less fortunate citizens face. Development for them means bringing the benefits they have to the people of Pakistan. But this is not possible. IFIs have a major say in the development model of Pakistan. Their air-conditioned offices in the city centre, far away from the homes of low-income groups, their fleet of expensive cars, constant trips abroad, workshops in five-star hotels and huge salaries anger the people, and it is not uncommon to hear them say “they are becoming rich on our problems.” EDUCATION Education is one of the priorities of poor families. However, the government schooling system is poor, and so poor families prefer to send their children to neighbourhood private schools, which are operated by local entrepreneurs. These are expensive as a result, so families have to decide which child to send to school and which child to send to work. This is a very difficult decision and causes ruptures in the family. Unlike neighbourhood schools, colleges and universities are very far away from low-income settlements, and a trip to them (in the absence of efficient and cheap transportation) and back is very expensive in terms of money and time. This also results in many young people giving up on higher education. This adversity affects the majority of women aspirants. All this is in addition to very high fees (often in tens of thousands), which low-income groups can seldom afford. CULTURE The Pakistan state is anti-culture and against students organising themselves. As a result, there is no student political activity. It is frowned upon, if not persecuted, and arts, music, dance and drama are discouraged. But all this has become an exclusive part of elite culture and held in elite institutions, often supported by cultural institutions of foreign countries. However, there are signs that this is changing and that the lower-middle class is slowly becoming a part of this. There was a time when student cards could subsidise travel, hostel charges, student canteens and library fees. All this has gone due to the neoliberal economic policies adopted by the state. Not only this, but every student who is admitted to a university signs a form saying he or she will not indulge in any form of discussion or debate regarding politics or religion. With this statement, dissent, which is a basic requirement of development and progress, is killed. WOMEN AND FAMILY STRUCTURES In the last 20 years, the family structure and the women of Karachi have changed. We have moved from joint to nuclear families. As a result, women have become comparatively independent and also dominate the fields of education and health. Self-willed marriages are increasing rapidly, and so is divorce. The conservative segment of society feels this is because people do not follow their religion. But this cannot be stopped. There is now a women’s football team, cricket team and hockey team, and women participate in athletics and martial arts and win. They participate in politics and participate in demonstrations, and often arrange them. Their public presence has increased too, and many women are in important government and private sector jobs as heads of institutions as well. But in spite of fairly strong women’s movements, women complain that they still have a long way to go before they can use their independence to achieve some form of equality with their men. They earn, but still they have to cook and clean. These changes have had a major impact on the design, especially on the incremental development, of the home and the future culture of the younger generation. Most homes possess a smartphone and have access to the internet and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, in spite of these developments, the city has almost no toilets for women, which restricts their working hours, and during their periods, they often have no option but to take the day off. In addition, the pavements that are available to them to walk on have obstructions such as trees, advertisement signage and broken patches. Often there are no pavements at all. This results in accidents and difficulty in moving around, especially with children and with senior citizens. There are many newly built roads that have no pavements at all and, when I have expressed this observation, I have been told “Arif Bhai, have you ever seen anyone walk on a pavement in Karachi?” FINAL NOTE There is much more that I have observed and written about and can safely conclude that, unless these and many other things are taken into account when trying to solve our problems and building a future, our problems will not be solved. Streets will flood, additional katchi abadis will be created, transport will not improve because it will not be maintained and managed, traffic will become more unbearable in the absence of management and, worst of all, women’s development will take place in an environment full of conflicts because the state will not support it. Hopefully, a new generation that is now growing up will be able to change this. The writer is an architect and urban planner.
