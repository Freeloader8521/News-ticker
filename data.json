The police had registered a case against Mazari, her spouse, Zainab Janjua and several PTI-linked lawyers, including Naeem Panjhuta and Fateullah Barkiunder, under anti-terror laws after the IHCBA alleged that the bar leadership was “assaulted” by the lawyers, the suspects had also raised slogans against state institutions. Mazari and the other booked lawyers had staged a protest on the premises of the IHC to oppose the suspension of Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri from judicial work. The hearing was presided over by PHC judge Justice Syed Mohammad Attique Shah, who granted a protective bail to the couple and asked them to appear before a relevant court by October 9. Mazari and her spouse appeared in the court today along with their lawyers\nAtaullah Kundi, Jahanzeb Mehsud, and Tariq Afghan.

Advocate Ataullah Kundi told Justice Shah that “a case was registered against the two petitioners in Islamabad,” to which he asked whether both of the petitioners were lawyers. Kundi responded: “Yes, both of them are lawyers and would like to appear in the court.” Addressing the petitioners, Justice Shah asked if this was their first time in Peshawar, to which Mazari replied in the affirmative, prompting Justice Shah to remark, “At least you came to Peshawar on the pretext of the FIR.” “You people never come to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa anyway,” he added. Advocate Kundi argued in front of Justice Shah that “Imaan Mazari is the voice of the people of KP and Balochistan,” adding that she was also a social worker in Islamabad.

      "title_orig": "Digital battlefield: Militants vs the state in the war of narratives",
      "summary_orig": "In September last year, militants attacked a police station in Swat district, martyring one policeman and injuring two others. The attack itself wasn’t out of the ordinary — after all, Swat is no stranger to terrorist attacks. What was different about this attack was the modus operandi adopted by the militants. Over the course of the next several days, investigators pieced together clues on the attack, which they later confirmed was carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED). “They had used an improvised explosive device, made of a power bank, which is mostly used for charging mobile phones,” District Police Officer Dr Zahidullah later told Dawn . The investigators, said Dr Zahidullah, pored over hours of CCTV footage to identify one of the militants, who in turn gave up the names of two other suspects. But the biggest breakthrough came during the course of the investigation when the militants admitted that they never used common means of communication to contact each other. Rather, they would communicate via the chat room of a popular video game, ‘Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds’, popularly known as PUBG, both to motivate new members and plan attacks. “The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” the DPO explained. The revelation should have raised alarm bells in the power corridors: that a local affiliate of a terror outfit was using a gaming platform not only to recruit, but also to plan attacks is rather concerning, given there isn’t much law enforcers can do to access or monitor these chatrooms. However, this cat-and-mouse chase with terror outfits when it comes to the use of digital technologies has become a norm now — not just in Pakistan, but across the world. Propaganda tool There was a time when militants published newspapers, periodicals, posters, magazines, and distributed CDs to fuel their propaganda machinery. In recent years, however, they have become as equipped in the use of digital media as state actors, if not more. Moreover, militants’ transnational outreach with like-minded jihadists has helped them formulate advanced propaganda techniques to counter the state narrative. This digital battle is waging at the same time as the conflict on the ground, highlighting the complexities of modern warfare, where state and non-state actors find themselves at the same level. Of late, an interesting yet concerning trend has come to light, where Pakistani state-run social media accounts, established over the last few years, are actively engaged in posting content related to militancy, countering militant propaganda, and building a state narrative. At the same time, the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) appears to have launched just as many social media accounts to counter the state’s messaging. Many of the accounts run by the terror outfit pose as news and research platforms, particularly on X (formerly Twitter). They often appear with a blue tick, which lends them more legitimacy and makes viewers more likely to follow them, who in turn believe accounts genuinely represent news and research organisations. Recently, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, as well as several state-linked accounts on X, posted links to militants’ WhatsApp accounts, urging the platform to take down these accounts for disseminating terrorist propaganda. In many cases, militant propaganda is as lethal as their actual acts of violence. With the advent of social media, where respective platforms struggle to distinguish between state and non-state actors, terrorists gain an advantage in exploiting local social grievances against the state, which in turn helps them with both recruitment and fund generation. Offline vs online Currently, every militant group, whether jihadist outfits or separatist groups like the Baloch insurgents, has dedicated propaganda teams. The TTP’s propaganda team, for example, is almost entirely focused on running the organisation’s propaganda efforts without participating in ground operations. Following the TTP, the Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), an emergent alliance of three Pakistani Jihadist factions, has made significant strides in its propaganda efforts . The latter produces high-quality, multilingual content, including infographics, videos featuring trainings and attacks, posters tailored to specific contexts and events to influence target audiences, and statements providing daily updates on attacks carried out by the alliance. Jihadists worldwide have amply developed the ability to globalise their agenda, opening a door for anyone to be part of a “digital” jihad as volunteers. These volunteers, unable to interact physically, play key roles in propagating jihadist propaganda, viewing it as a religious duty, and do so without expecting monetary returns, instead utilising their own resources to further the jihadist cause. In this context, the Islamic State and its regional affiliate, the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), have conducted or attempted to carry out attacks globally, from Russia to the US, by leveraging the power of digital propaganda to inspire others. Utilising sophisticated and hard-to-trace encrypted communications, they have expanded their reach worldwide, leaving state authorities struggling to keep pace. This is why security analysts worldwide emphasise that winning the war of narratives is just as crucial as winning the war on the ground. The extensive advent of social media and AI has enabled militant groups to disseminate their ideologies swiftly and widely, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers, with reduced costs and threats of being traced. This allows militant organisations to maintain a presence on the propaganda front, even if severely compromised operationally. In such situations, militant outfits’ core objective remains to inspire others through propaganda and ultimately regain lost strength. From gaming apps to secret chat rooms Pakistani security officials maintain that transnational jihadists have increasingly turned to online gaming applications as a means of secure communication, aiming to evade detection. “After PUBG, there are indications that they are now using Ludo Star for communication to evade possible detection. Militants, particularly the transnational ones, are more tech-savvy than domestic ones. However, these transnational groups often act as trainers, sharing their technical expertise with local groups. We are faced with multi-domain threat scenarios and are battling it on a daily basis. You have to fight it both in the real world and the virtual one,” said a senior Pakistani security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media. The ISKP is a prime example, which, despite suffering significant setbacks in recent years, has persisted with an intense propaganda campaign to attract fresh recruits and thereby maintain its standing as the most dreaded militant outfit globally. The latest report by the UN sanctions monitoring team , based on intelligence inputs from member states, has raised serious concerns about the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and various communication platforms for propaganda and recruitment purposes, allowing terrorist groups to evade detection by state authorities. “Both Al-Qaeda and ISIL (the militant Islamic State in Levant) continued to experiment with different communication platforms to glorify violence and promote an idealised life under their rule. ISIL tried to exploit TikTok’s reach and algorithmic power for recruitment. Al-Qaeda continued to try to exploit gaming platforms for recruitment. Once an initial contact has been made, potential recruits were directed to encrypted apps (such as Telegram, Element, Discord, Threema, or Zangi), for tasking. (These) groups also continued to experiment with artificial intelligence (AI), mostly for recruitment, and to enhance propaganda,” the report says . Al-Qaeda’s propaganda tactics, utilising modern tools, then trickle down to its like-minded jihadists, such as the TTP. Al-Qaeda has long been regarded as the architect of propaganda tactics for both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. Both ISKP and Al-Qaeda, along with the latter’s local jihadist allies, consider propaganda an integral part of their existence, just like their operational part. A war Pakistan cannot fight alone Militant groups have consistently outmanoeuvred law enforcement authorities on multiple fronts in recent months, employing sophisticated propaganda strategies, adapting revenue generation methods and frequently changing operational tactics in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, while the state remains entrenched in traditional approaches. Beyond the digital outreach of militants, including the TTP and Baloch armed separatists, to their target audience in the cyber realm, a growingly alarming trend that has emerged in recent months is the increased physical accessibility of militants to locals in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, compared to state officials. In areas with high militant concentrations, state authorities often find themselves confined to government compounds, while locals’ interactions with militants are becoming routine occurrences, causing a significant disconnect between state representatives and locals. This distance substantially benefits militants in bolstering both their physical presence and ideological outreach through preaching. The threat posed by militancy cannot be defeated by a single country; its multidimensional nature demands a collaborative approach involving multiple nations. Even the world’s most advanced countries struggle to combat terrorism alone, so it’s unrealistic to expect Pakistan, with its meagre resources, to tackle it solo. Furthermore, the increasing use of proxy wars, which has become a norm in the region, where militants are employed by rival states to weaken adversaries without going into direct confrontation, creates a perilous cycle. This trend prompts retaliatory measures in kind from the target state, fuelling further instability and inadvertently strengthening the militants’ threat.

      "summary_en": "In September last year, militants attacked a police station in Swat district, martyring one policeman and injuring two others. The attack itself wasn’t out of the ordinary — after all, Swat is no stranger to terrorist attacks. What was different about this attack was the modus operandi adopted by the militants. Over the course of the next several days, investigators pieced together clues on the attack, which they later confirmed was carried out using an improvised explosive device (IED). “They had used an improvised explosive device, made of a power bank, which is mostly used for charging mobile phones,” District Police Officer Dr Zahidullah later told Dawn . The investigators, said Dr Zahidullah, pored over hours of CCTV footage to identify one of the militants, who in turn gave up the names of two other suspects. But the biggest breakthrough came during the course of the investigation when the militants admitted that they never used common means of communication to contact each other. Rather, they would communicate via the chat room of a popular video game, ‘Player Unknown’s Battlegrounds’, popularly known as PUBG, both to motivate new members and plan attacks. “The militants would play PUBG to practice and motivate their group members for battle against the state and would use the chat room for communication,” the DPO explained. The revelation should have raised alarm bells in the power corridors: that a local affiliate of a terror outfit was using a gaming platform not only to recruit, but also to plan attacks is rather concerning, given there isn’t much law enforcers can do to access or monitor these chatrooms. However, this cat-and-mouse chase with terror outfits when it comes to the use of digital technologies has become a norm now — not just in Pakistan, but across the world. Propaganda tool There was a time when militants published newspapers, periodicals, posters, magazines, and distributed CDs to fuel their propaganda machinery. In recent years, however, they have become as equipped in the use of digital media as state actors, if not more. Moreover, militants’ transnational outreach with like-minded jihadists has helped them formulate advanced propaganda techniques to counter the state narrative. This digital battle is waging at the same time as the conflict on the ground, highlighting the complexities of modern warfare, where state and non-state actors find themselves at the same level. Of late, an interesting yet concerning trend has come to light, where Pakistani state-run social media accounts, established over the last few years, are actively engaged in posting content related to militancy, countering militant propaganda, and building a state narrative. At the same time, the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) appears to have launched just as many social media accounts to counter the state’s messaging. Many of the accounts run by the terror outfit pose as news and research platforms, particularly on X (formerly Twitter). They often appear with a blue tick, which lends them more legitimacy and makes viewers more likely to follow them, who in turn believe accounts genuinely represent news and research organisations. Recently, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, as well as several state-linked accounts on X, posted links to militants’ WhatsApp accounts, urging the platform to take down these accounts for disseminating terrorist propaganda. In many cases, militant propaganda is as lethal as their actual acts of violence. With the advent of social media, where respective platforms struggle to distinguish between state and non-state actors, terrorists gain an advantage in exploiting local social grievances against the state, which in turn helps them with both recruitment and fund generation. Offline vs online Currently, every militant group, whether jihadist outfits or separatist groups like the Baloch insurgents, has dedicated propaganda teams. The TTP’s propaganda team, for example, is almost entirely focused on running the organisation’s propaganda efforts without participating in ground operations. Following the TTP, the Ittehad-ul-Mujahideen Pakistan (IMP), an emergent alliance of three Pakistani Jihadist factions, has made significant strides in its propaganda efforts . The latter produces high-quality, multilingual content, including infographics, videos featuring trainings and attacks, posters tailored to specific contexts and events to influence target audiences, and statements providing daily updates on attacks carried out by the alliance. Jihadists worldwide have amply developed the ability to globalise their agenda, opening a door for anyone to be part of a “digital” jihad as volunteers. These volunteers, unable to interact physically, play key roles in propagating jihadist propaganda, viewing it as a religious duty, and do so without expecting monetary returns, instead utilising their own resources to further the jihadist cause. In this context, the Islamic State and its regional affiliate, the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP), have conducted or attempted to carry out attacks globally, from Russia to the US, by leveraging the power of digital propaganda to inspire others. Utilising sophisticated and hard-to-trace encrypted communications, they have expanded their reach worldwide, leaving state authorities struggling to keep pace. This is why security analysts worldwide emphasise that winning the war of narratives is just as crucial as winning the war on the ground. The extensive advent of social media and AI has enabled militant groups to disseminate their ideologies swiftly and widely, transcending linguistic and geographical barriers, with reduced costs and threats of being traced. This allows militant organisations to maintain a presence on the propaganda front, even if severely compromised operationally. In such situations, militant outfits’ core objective remains to inspire others through propaganda and ultimately regain lost strength. From gaming apps to secret chat rooms Pakistani security officials maintain that transnational jihadists have increasingly turned to online gaming applications as a means of secure communication, aiming to evade detection. “After PUBG, there are indications that they are now using Ludo Star for communication to evade possible detection. Militants, particularly the transnational ones, are more tech-savvy than domestic ones. However, these transnational groups often act as trainers, sharing their technical expertise with local groups. We are faced with multi-domain threat scenarios and are battling it on a daily basis. You have to fight it both in the real world and the virtual one,” said a senior Pakistani security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to talk to the media. The ISKP is a prime example, which, despite suffering significant setbacks in recent years, has persisted with an intense propaganda campaign to attract fresh recruits and thereby maintain its standing as the most dreaded militant outfit globally. The latest report by the UN sanctions monitoring team , based on intelligence inputs from member states, has raised serious concerns about the increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and various communication platforms for propaganda and recruitment purposes, allowing terrorist groups to evade detection by state authorities. “Both Al-Qaeda and ISIL (the militant Islamic State in Levant) continued to experiment with different communication platforms to glorify violence and promote an idealised life under their rule. ISIL tried to exploit TikTok’s reach and algorithmic power for recruitment. Al-Qaeda continued to try to exploit gaming platforms for recruitment. Once an initial contact has been made, potential recruits were directed to encrypted apps (such as Telegram, Element, Discord, Threema, or Zangi), for tasking. (These) groups also continued to experiment with artificial intelligence (AI), mostly for recruitment, and to enhance propaganda,” the report says . Al-Qaeda’s propaganda tactics, utilising modern tools, then trickle down to its like-minded jihadists, such as the TTP. Al-Qaeda has long been regarded as the architect of propaganda tactics for both the Afghan and Pakistani Taliban. Both ISKP and Al-Qaeda, along with the latter’s local jihadist allies, consider propaganda an integral part of their existence, just like their operational part. A war Pakistan cannot fight alone Militant groups have consistently outmanoeuvred law enforcement authorities on multiple fronts in recent months, employing sophisticated propaganda strategies, adapting revenue generation methods and frequently changing operational tactics in both Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, while the state remains entrenched in traditional approaches. Beyond the digital outreach of militants, including the TTP and Baloch armed separatists, to their target audience in the cyber realm, a growingly alarming trend that has emerged in recent months is the increased physical accessibility of militants to locals in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, compared to state officials. In areas with high militant concentrations, state authorities often find themselves confined to government compounds, while locals’ interactions with militants are becoming routine occurrences, causing a significant disconnect between state representatives and locals. This distance substantially benefits militants in bolstering both their physical presence and ideological outreach through preaching. The threat posed by militancy cannot be defeated by a single country; its multidimensional nature demands a collaborative approach involving multiple nations. Even the world’s most advanced countries struggle to combat terrorism alone, so it’s unrealistic to expect Pakistan, with its meagre resources, to tackle it solo. Furthermore, the increasing use of proxy wars, which has become a norm in the region, where militants are employed by rival states to weaken adversaries without going into direct confrontation, creates a perilous cycle. This trend prompts retaliatory measures in kind from the target state, fuelling further instability and inadvertently strengthening the militants’ threat. If Pakistan is to effectively combat militancy, it must effectively work on building alliances with other countries in the region as well as incorporate a more transnational approach aimed at countering militants’ propaganda and digital warfare.

      "summary_orig": "Airports in Copenhagen and Oslo reopened on Tuesday, police said, hours after unidentified drones in their airspace caused flight diversions and other travel disruption. In the Danish capital Copenhagen, police said several large drones seen over the airport for several hours late on Monday eventually flew away on their own. “The drones have disappeared and the airport is open again,” Deputy Police Inspector Jakob Hansen told reporters. “We didn’t take the drones down,” he added. Hansen said police were cooperating with the Danish military and intelligence service to find out where the drones had come from. He said police were also working with colleagues in Oslo after drone sightings in the Norwegian capital also caused the airport to close for several hours. “We had two different drone sightings,” Oslo airport spokeswoman Monica Fasting told AFP . “We reopened the airport around 3:15 am (6:15 am PKT),” she said. Flights were diverted to nearby destinations during the closures, and officials at both airports said they expected some delays and disruptions to continue on Tuesday. The incidents came after the governments of Poland , Estonia and Romania accused Russia of violating their airspace this month, allegations that Moscow has brushed off. Asked whether the drones above Copenhagen airport could have come from Russia, Hansen, the deputy police inspector, said: “We don’t know at this point.” Danish police also said that drones that shut the country’s main airport appeared to have been flown by “a capable operator” seeking to demonstrate certain abilities, adding that no suspects had been identified. “We have concluded that this was what we would call a capable operator,” Danish police Chief Superintendent Jens Jespersen told reporters on Tuesday, referring to the drones observed in Copenhagen. “It’s an actor who has the capabilities, the will and the tools to show off in this way,” Jespersen said, adding that it was too early to say if the incidents in Denmark and Norway were linked.",

      "summary_orig": "• PA President Abbas calls on all states to follow suit • Dar attends, but doesn’t address high-level moot • PM due to meet Trump alongside Muslim leaders • Palestine flag unfurled at London mission NEW YORK: France and Monaco extended formal recognition to the State of Palestine at a high-level conference on Monday. “We must do everything within our power to preserve the very possibility of a two-state solution, Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security,” French President Emmanuel Macron said before announcing the diplomatic move, drawing lengthy applause from the audience. Macron outlined a framework for a “renewed Palestinian Authority” under which France would open an embassy subject to factors such as reforms, a ceasefire and the release of all remaining prisoners held in Gaza. Andorra, Belgium, Luxembourg and San Marino were also expected to recognise a Palestinian state ahead of this week’s UN General Assembly, after Australia, Britain, Canada, Portugal and Malta did so over the weekend. Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who represented Pakistan at the conference, was not among the speakers — which inc­luded heads of state and government from countries such as Turkiye, Australia, Brazil and Canada, among others. PM Shehbaz Sharif, who reached New York on Monday, did not attend the meeting. In a statement, the Foreign Office said that Pakistan actively participated in the conference. Taking to X, the foreign minister welcomed ann­ouncements regarding the recognition of Palestine by several countries. Recalling that Pakistan was among the first countries to recognize the State of Palestine following its declaration of independence in 1988, he urged all countries that have not yet done so to take similar steps in line with their commitment to international law. This call was echoed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, who addressed the moot via video link after he was denied a visa by the United States. “We call on those who have not yet done so to follow suit. We call for your support so that Palestine becomes a full-fledged member of the United Nations,” he said, promising reforms and elections within a year of a ceasefire. The conference with a focus on the two-state solution comes at a time when the Western powers in a break from their decades-old policy have agreed to recognise the Palestinian state. The UK, responsible for the 1917 Balfour Declaration that led to the creation of the State of Israel, also opened the Palestine embassy in London on Monday. The high-level moot has followed a similar summit in July this year, where the New York Declaration was first drafted, and later adopted by the UN General Assembly on Sept 12. Earlier in the day, FM Ishaq Dar took part in the Commonwealth Foreign Affairs Ministers Meeting (CFAMM) at UN Head­quarters. He also participated in consultations hosted by Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Qatar Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani. Other participants included the deputy prime ministers of Jordan and UAE, and the foreign ministers of Egypt, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Turkiye. He also met with his Canadian counterpart Anita Anand. Meeting with Trump Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar addresses a UNGA meeting on the 30th anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women.—X / ForeignOfficePk PM Shehbaz will represent Pakistan at a multilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump, the White House and Pakistani diplomats said on Monday. White House Spok­esperson Karoline Leavitt did not specify the meeting’s agenda, but sources indicated that the Israeli war in Gaza would be the dominant topic. The meeting will include leaders of eight Muslim majority countries, including Pakistan, Turkiye, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Indonesia, Egypt, the UAE and Jordan. But Trump is expected to address the UN General Assembly ahead of the multilateral meeting. According to Ms Leavitt, the president will also touch upon how globalist institutions have significantly decayed the world order, and he will articulate his straightforward and constructive vision for the world. Trump himself opposed the moves by Britain, Canada and Australia to recognize the state of Palestine, which France is due to follow on Monday. “The president has been very clear he disagrees with this decision,” Leavitt said, noting that he had publicly done so with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer during a UK state visit last week. “Frankly, he believes it’s a reward to Hamas. So he believes these decisions are just more talk and not enough action from some of our friends and allies, and I think you’ll hear him talk about that tomorrow” at the UN, she added. Flag-raising Meanwhile, a day after it extended recognition to the state of Palestine, a flag-raising ceremony was held outside the Pale­stinian mission in London on Monday. Head of Mission Husam Zomlot hailed the “long overdue” recognition as the flag was raised in front of a crowd outside the building in Hammersmith in west London. Holding up a plaque reading ‘Embassy of the State of Palestine’, Mr Zomlot said it would be put up soon, “pending some legal work, some bureaucratic work”. He called the recognition move an “acknowledgement of a historic injustice” at a time of “unimaginable suffering” for the Palestinian people in the war in Gaza. He said the UK’s recognition had particular resonance as Britain was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, through the 1917 Balfour Declaration. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the Palestinian Authority could now “set up an embassy and an ambassador in the UK”. Following Sunday’s announcement, Britain’s foreign ministry updated its travel advice page to remove the reference to “Occupied Palestinian territories”, replacing it with “Palestine”.

Head of Mission Husam Zomlot hailed the “long overdue” recognition as the flag was raised in front of a crowd outside the building in Hammersmith in west London. Holding up a plaque reading ‘Embassy of the State of Palestine’, Mr Zomlot said it would be put up soon, “pending some legal work, some bureaucratic work”. He called the recognition move an “acknowledgement of a historic injustice” at a time of “unimaginable suffering” for the Palestinian people in the war in Gaza. He said the UK’s recognition had particular resonance as Britain was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, through the 1917 Balfour Declaration. UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said the Palestinian Authority could now “set up an embassy and an ambassador in the UK”. Following Sunday’s announcement, Britain’s foreign ministry updated its travel advice page to remove the reference to “Occupied Palestinian territories”, replacing it with “Palestine”.

Communities in Noraja Bhutta, Bahadurpur, Basti Lang, Kanu, and Dipal in Jalalpur Pirwala; Tarut Basharat, Daily Rajanpur, and Belaywala in Lodhran; Dunyapur, Jhangra, and Muradpur Soiwala in Bahawalpur were forced to live on the banks of the embankment, as their homes remained inundated. Basti Lang resident Muhammad Bakhsh said the water was rising again in his union council, adding it would continue to rise if the Noraja Bhutta embankment was not plugged completely. “We are also hearing about another medium level flood in the Sutlej approaching Jalalpur Pirwala in a day or two, which would further increase the water level around our homes,” he said. “We are also hearing that the government is plugging the Noraja Bhutta embankment but the water has yet to recede from these areas…,” he rued. Ijaz Khan, from the Tarut Bashart union council, said that the water level was increasing due to the breaches. He said that the government was placing heavy stones around the M-5 Motorway bridge to save it, but the water was not receding. Multan Irrigation Department Chief Engineer Nawaz Bajwa told Dawn that three breaches in the Noraja Bhutta embankment along the Sutlej River were plugged to save Jalalpur Pirwala city. He said that they also saved the primary gas pipeline to Punjab. Punjab Minister for Irrigation Kazim Pirzada revealed that 70 and 90 per cent of the population in Alipur and Jalalpur Pirwala, respectively, was affected by the recent floods. He said that Jalalpur required evacuation and Alipur needed a massive relief operation, with teams working round the clock to deliver essential supplies to Sultanpur, Shahbazpur, Seetpur, and other affected towns. Normal flow Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that the water flow across major rivers in Punjab had returned to normal levels. He said a low- to medium-level flood situation continued in the Sutlej River. According to PDMA data, the Sutlej River is flowing at 95,000 cusecs at Ganda Singh Wala and 81,000 cusecs at the Suleimanki point. The Chenab River shows a flow of 55,000 cusecs at Marala, which reduces to 24,000 cusecs at Khanki Headworks and 29,000 cusecs at Qadirabad. The flow at Head Trimmu was recorded at 35,000 cusecs. The Panjnad Headworks reported a flow of 118,000 cusecs. Meanwhile, the Ravi River presented lower readings, with 6,000 cusecs at Jassar, 9,000 cusecs at Shahdara, and 30,000 cusecs at Head Sidhnai. The flow at Balloki Headworks was measured at 28,000 cusecs. Published in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "• Justice Aminuddin Khan issues detailed reasoning, says Oct 23 order by five judges more akin to ‘legislation than interpretation’ • Civilians’ trials in military courts ‘long understood as valid and operative’, says Justice Mazhar ISLAMABAD: Justice Aminuddin Khan has said that though the procedural framework under the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 includes due process protections, the absence of an independent right of appeal to a civilian court has rendered its application to civilians constitutionally incomplete. He made these remarks in a 68-page judgement to justify the May 7 short order on a set of 38 intra-court appeals, which challenged the Oct 23, 2023, order on military trials of the civilians. Justice Khan explained that this deficiency required legislative intervention, urging parliament to do the needful in 45 days. According to Justice Khan, the Constitutional Bench had referred the matter to parliament for the enactment of appropriate amendments, with the expectation that such institutional deference would be accorded due respect. He, however, again sought necessary amendments or suitable legislation within a period of 45 days to provide right of appeal in the high courts against convictions rendered by court martial or military courts under sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of clause (d) of subsection (1) of section 2, read with subsection (4) of Section 59. Justice Khan observed that a fair trial demanded that the forum should be fair, impartial, and governed by transparent rules. The PAA, as currently framed and applied in the present context, meets this constitutional requirement, Justice Khan said, adding it was held that the conduct of trials under PAA, where exercised within the statutory limits and supported by procedural safeguards, did not violate fair trial standards. On May 7, a seven-judge Constitutional Bench restored by a majority of 5-2 key provisions of the Pakistan Army Act under which civilians were convicted for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, arson attacks on military installations. The short order had also set aside the Oct 23 judgement, restoring Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) and Section 59 (4) of the PAA. These provisions were struck down by a majority of four to one by a five-judge bench in October 2023. ‘Reading down’ approach The interpretive technique of reading down, as employed in the Oct 23 judgement, was inapposite, Justice Khan said, adding that the doctrine of reading down was a tool of judicial restraint designed to preserve the constitutionality of statutes by construing them narrowly in case of ambiguity. It cannot be deployed to insert qualifications or restrictions into clear constitutional provisions, he observed. The Oct 23 order purported to use reading down to override the unambiguous text of Article 8(3)(a), effectively substituting judicial preference for constitutional command, Justice Khan emphasised, adding this approach crossed the threshold of legitimate interpretation and entered the domain of constitutional amendment. The judicial function is to interpret, not to legislate, he stressed. Article 8(3)(a) is a self-contained constitutional provision. It categorically exempts laws enacted for the Armed Forces, for purposes of discipline and discharge of duties, from the operation of fundamental rights, Justice Khan said, calling it a deliberate legislative choice by the framers. The introduction of Article 8(5) as a qualifying provision in this context is doctrinally and textually unsound. Article 8(5) deals with the suspension of rights under emergency powers and does not, and cannot, override the permanent structural exclusion under Article 8(3)(a), he added. Article 8(3)(a) exempts laws relating to the armed forces from the purview of fundamental rights, explicitly recognising a parallel regime for military discipline. Article 245 further empowers the armed forces to act in defence of Pakistan and in aid of civil authority, indicating that the Constitution contemplates a domain of operations and discipline governed by military command and distinct legal processes, Justice Khan said Justice Khan said the adjudicatory authority exercised by military courts over civilians does not infringe the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers. Article 175(3) is not offended by the existence or operation of military courts within their legal remit. Additional note Meanwhile, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar, though concurring, said in his additional note that the trial of civilians only for specific offences as provided under Section 2 (d) (i) and (ii) was not a new phenomenon. It is a ground reality that the provisions of PAA extending jurisdiction to certain civilians have stood connected appeals for several decades, receiving the tacit approval of successive legislatures and the silent acquiescence of the Supreme Court. The fact that these provisions remained unchallenged or were not declared ultra vires at an earlier stage suggests that they were long understood as valid and operative within the constitutional scheme, Justice Mazhar explained. It was only in the aftermath of the events of May 9, 2023, when prosecutions of civilians under PAA acquired public and political prominence that this question was brought into sharp focus. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to ask whether it is the law itself that is infirm, or whether the sudden urgency of the present moment has led to a judicial reappraisal that stands at odds with decades of settled acceptance, he argued.

      "title_orig": "Iran’s Araqchi says Tehran will not respond to language of pressure over its nuclear work",
      "summary_orig": "Iran insists diplomacy is the only way to resolve a decades-long nuclear dispute with the West, Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told Iranian state TV on Monday, adding it was time for the West to choose “cooperation or confrontation” amid looming sanctions. Britain, France and Germany, known as the E3, launched a 30-day process on August 28 to reimpose United Nations sanctions, accusing Tehran of failing to abide by a 2015 deal with world powers aimed at preventing it from developing a nuclear weapon. Araqchi said he will meet with his European counterparts and the head of the UN nuclear watchdog, Rafael Grossi, in New York this week on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly to discuss Iran’s nuclear programme. Two European diplomats told Reuters the meeting will be on Tuesday. “They have tested Iran repeatedly and know we do not respond to the language of pressure and threat,” Araqchi said. “I hope we can find a diplomatic solution in the coming days, otherwise, Tehran will take appropriate measures.” The European powers have offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months — to give diplomacy a chance — if Iran restores access for UN nuclear inspectors to its nuclear sites, addresses concerns about its stock of enriched uranium and resumes talks with the United States. But amid the looming threat of sanctions, two European diplomats said Iran’s clerical rulers have so far failed to meet the conditions set by the E3. “The ball is in Iran’s camp. It is up to it to quickly take the concrete steps in the coming days to avert snapback. If not, then sanctions will be reimposed,” said one of the diplomats. If Tehran and the E3 fail to reach a deal on an extension by the end of September 27, then all UN sanctions will be reimposed on Iran, where the economy already struggles with crippling sanctions reimposed since 2018 after President Donald Trump ditched the pact during his first term. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran would overcome any reimposition of UN sanctions , but one insider said mounting discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy was rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers. Soon after the US and Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran’s parliament passed a law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and stipulating that any inspections must be approved by Iran’s Supreme National Security Council. On September 9, the IAEA and Tehran reached a deal to resume inspections at nuclear sites. “I am in New York to use these remaining days for diplomatic consultations that might lead to a solution … if it is not found, we will continue our path,” Araqchi said. IAEA says Iran nuclear diplomacy at a ‘difficult juncture’ Meanwhile, Grossi told AFP that diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme were at a “difficult juncture” but dialogue would continue. The UN Security Council voted on Friday to reimpose UN sanctions that had been frozen, after three European governments activated the “snapback” mechanism in a decade-old nuclear agreement, accusing Iran of non-compliance. “It’s obviously quite a difficult juncture. It’s a very difficult situation we are facing right now,” the IAEA chief said, adding that talks between the involved parties were planned in New York for today. “What’s important is the communications are continuing. We are planning to see each other if possible today, Monday, here in New York, and perhaps more meetings during the week.” Friday’s vote means that the sanctions, which were suspended in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities set out in the 2015 deal, will take effect again on September 28 unless Iran can persuade the council to relent in the next week. Tehran said the action by the European powers — Britain, France and Germany — undermined months of engagement with the IAEA aimed at resuming monitoring and ensuring compliance with international rules. Grossi praised the active diplomacy of French President Emmanuel Macron to salvage a deal, and said that there were still lines of communication between Tehran and Washington. “Emmanuel Macron is very present, has been historically, and I respect him enormously,” Grossi said. “I think the special envoy, Ambassador [Steve] Witkoff, has also been involved and actively exploring different channels and presenting a number of ideas,” Grossi said. Grossi said his dialogue with Witkoff had enabled him to understand Washington’s position and red lines. “And the IAEA is not a party to the agreement — but it’s indispensable in every scenario. So we continue the work with Ambassador Witkoff,” Grossi said. Western governments have long accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition Tehran denies. Tehran has also criticised the IAEA for failing to condemn the Israeli and US strikes. Paris, London, and Berlin have stressed their demands that the Islamic Republic grant IAEA inspectors full access to nuclear sites, including those damaged by Israeli and American attacks last June. They also call for a resumption of negotiations, particularly with the US side. Tehran says it is resisting political pressure and accuses the Europeans of not taking up a “balanced” proposal, the details of which have not been disclosed. “We are not at a point where people are not talking to each other, and you have to convince them to come together,” Grossi said. “So does that mean that I am optimistic? Well, neither optimistic nor pessimistic,” he said, adding that he remained hopeful that “we can still have an agreement”. “If we don’t have it, I think we have to try to (right) the boat as soon as possible to avoid prolonged confrontation and perhaps more attacks.” Grossi also said he would seek to succeed Antonio Guterres as secretary general of the UN when his term ends in December 2026.",
