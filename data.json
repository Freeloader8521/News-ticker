      "summary_orig": "The Karachi police arrested two of the seven cops who were booked after a “teenage boy” died under controversial circumstances in the Special Investigation Unit’s (SIU) custody, while the victim’s relatives held a sit-in at Sohrab Goth on Saturday to demand justice. The seven cops were suspended a day ago after the incident came to light. While the police claimed that Muhammad Irfan died of heart attack, his relatives alleged that he was tortured to death. A first information report (FIR) of the incident was registered the same day at the Saddar Police Station on the complaint of SIU and Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Station House Officer (SHO) Mumtaz Ahmed under Sections 34 (common intention) and 319 (manslaughter) of the Pakistan Penal Code against seven nominated SIU/CIA officers. “The SIU/CIA police have handed over custody of two suspects nominated in FIR … who have been arrested. If need be, we shall convert the case to 302 (premeditated murder) and arrest more SIU officials if they were found involved,” said South Deputy Inspector General of Police Syed Asad Raza whicle speaking to Dawn . He confirmed that “preliminary post-mortem report establishes torture”. Meanwhile, a large number of relatives and members of the community staged a sit-in at an Edhi morgue at Sohrab Goth while carrying the coffin of the victim, whose body was kept at the morgue, and blocked the main road. Senior journalist Shahid Jatoi, one of the protesters, told Dawn that the people were demonstrating because “the case has been registered on complaint of the killers”. He said the policemen had promised the relatives that  the FIR would be registered on the family’s complaint. “The relatives visited the SIU/CIA centre on Friday night for the purpose of the FIR, but the police had already got the FIR registered on behalf of the state. They were informed that since FIR had already been registered, a second case could not be registered for the same offence,” Jatoi said. He added that since then, three other people, who were detained along with Irfan, were released and cleared of any wrongdoing, the family and those gathered believed that the four were “innocent” and were tortured in custody, leading to Irfan’s death. The protesters urged the Sindh chief minister and police chief to provide justice in the matter. Following the sit-in, thousands were stranded on major thoroughfares as traffic piled up and spilled onto nearby routes.

      "summary_orig": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Saturday claimed the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, calling for the National Finance Commission (NFC) meeting to be convened immediately. He made these remarks while addressing a jirga in the province’s Khyber district today. Last week, CM Afridi had called for a grand peace jirga in a bid to discuss avenues for “establishment of peace” in the province. “After 9/11, Pakistan entered a foreign war without our consent,” CM Afridi said, referring to the attacks of Sept 11, 2001, when deadly plane hijackings claimed almost 3,000 lives. “It was said that Pakistan needs sacrifices. For Pakistan, we left our houses. Drone strikes and military operations started here,” Afridi said. “We were made the scapegoats,” he told the crowd. “Our homes, markets, and mosques were destroyed, yet we gave sacrifices for Pakistan.” The chief minister warned against the launching of any new military operation in the province’s tribal districts, saying the people will “not be made into scapegoats again”. Afridi added that despite the claims of security forces in 2018 that Khyber district and other tribal areas had been cleared [of militants], “preparations are again being made for new military operations”. The newly elected provincial chief executive said KP stands with the state when it comes to peace, but “under no circumstance will we support collateral damage”. “If any innocent life is lost this time, there will be accountability,” Afridi said. He also demanded that any future decisions regarding the region “must include the provincial government and parliamentarians from KP,” rejecting decisions made behind “closed doors”. PTI leadership meet at CM House Prior to the jirga, a meeting of PTI’s senior leadership took place at CM House in Peshawar, according to a statement by press secretary to CM Sahibzada Hassan. Chairman PTI Barrister Gohar, CM Sohail Afridi, PTI Provincial President Junaid Akbar, Asad Qaiser and other leaders participated in the meeting, per the statement. The law and order situation of the province was discussed in detail during the meeting. It was decided to convene a peace jirga in the KP Assembly, with former CMs, governors, scholars, jirga leaders, civil society, lawyers and important personalities to be invited. “The aim of the peace jirga is to eliminate terrorism and formulate a unified strategy for sustainable peace,” said the statement. “Participants of the meeting paid tribute to the sacrifices of the police.’ “Provincial government stands by the police force,” CM Afridi was quoted as saying. “Providing modern equipment, training and resources to the police is the top priority of the government.” Rise in terrorist incidents Pakistan has witnessed a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and law enforcement agencies (LEAs) personnel. Earlier this week, Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations , which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements. Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan . A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.",

      "summary_orig": "Security forces killed three terrorists while foiling an attempted suicide attack in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s North Waziristan district, the military’s media wing said on Saturday. A statement issued today from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that security forces foiled a “major terrorist incident and averted a potential catastrophic attack” a day ago after conducting an intelligence-based operation  (IBO) in the district’s general area of Jhallar based on credible intelligence about reported terrorist presence belonging to “Indian proxy Fitna al-Khawarij preparing a vehicle-borne suicide bomber for a major terrorist activity”. Fitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It added that troops effectively engaged them at their location and destroyed the vehicle being prepared for the suicide attack while eliminating three “Indian-sponsored” terrorists through “precise and skillful engagement”. The ISPR said that a sanitisation operation was being conducted to eliminate any other terrorists found in the area. “Relentless counterterrorism campaign under vision ‘Azm-i-Istehkam’ (as approved by Federal Apex Committee on National Action Plan) by security forces and law enforcement agencies of Pakistan will continue at full pace to wipe out menace of foreign-sponsored and supported terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR concluded. Pakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022. Earlier this week, KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government. The PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations , which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements . Although the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counter-terrorism operations under the National Action Plan . A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.",

      "summary_orig": "Defence Minister Khawaja Asif said on Saturday that the government was committed to making Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) a profitable institution. He made the remarks during a ceremony at the Islamabad International Airport to mark the national flag carrier’s inaugural flight from the capital to the United Kingdom (UK) after a gap of nearly five years. Last month, the airline had received Third Country Operator approval for the UK. The development came after Britain’s Department of Transport concluded that security arrangements in the country were “satisfactory and in line with international standards”. Flight operations to Manchester are resuming in the first phase, with plans to extend them to Birmingham and London in the second. “After a long and difficult delay of five years, today the resumption of flights from Islamabad to Manchester is a feat we have achieved through our hard work and determination,” Asif said. “This success is not a coincidence, but a living testament of the government’s priorities, strong leadership, and efforts,” he said. The minister said that the country’s image suffered immensely when the national carrier faced international bans. “We took it as a national challenge. The government, without wasting a single moment, empowered and provided resources to the country’s aviation bodies,” he said. “To meet the standards of the world’s strictest aviation bodies, we completely restructured pilot training, the licensing system, aircraft maintenance, and safety protocols,” he added. “It is a matter of great pride that we raised our standards to such a level that the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) restored its confidence in PIA,“ the minister said. Asif also expressed gratitude to Pakistani diplomats and staff based in Britain and Europe, saying that they “presented Pakistan’s case effectively at a diplomatic level, provided evidence, and maintained continuous engagement” with the relevant authorities. He said that their persistent efforts had enabled the national carrier to resume its regular flight operations. “I would especially like to thank the staff of the British High Commission in Pakistan and their team leader Jane Marriott,” he said, adding that they also played a part in accelerating the process and removing obstacles. “Their cooperation highlights the strong friendship between the two countries,” he said. The minister added that the government was committed to making PIA a profitable institution so that it could support the economy instead of being a burden. The minister said that the flights to Manchester were an “excellent start” but the government would not stop there. “We plan that after Manchester, flights to London and Birmingham will also be started,” he said. The minister directed the PIA management to ensure safety, punctuality and customer satisfaction. “Let us vow today to make PIA reach the status it had once achieved,” he said. In a post on X, Asif said the restoration of flights was part of a series of measures taken by the government for the restoration of national institutions, improvement of public facilities, and the promotion of Pakistan’s image at the international level. He said that the statement of the aviation minister during the PTI era “caused damage to the reputation of our beloved country, the aviation sector, and the national airline PIA, which the current government, under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, has rectified”. “The resumption of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester marks the beginning of a new era of connectivity between Pakistan and the UK, which will provide significant convenience to the Pakistani community residing there,” Asif said. Meanwhile, Marriott, the British High Commissioner to Pakistan, said: “A genuine joy to wave off the first flight by a Pakistani carrier to the UK in five years. Here’s to more destinations and connections!” PM Shehbaz felicitated the nation, especially Pakistanis residing in the UK, on the commencement of direct flights from Islamabad to Manchester. The prime minister also lauded the efforts of Asif, the Civil Aviation Authority, PIA and the officials of the relevant entities in this regard. “Pakistans image is being restored across the world,” he said, adding that the suspension had damaged PIAs reputation, which was now restored after years of dedicated efforts. The prime minister further observed that the Pakistani community living in the UK would greatly benefit from these direct flights. “The resumption of direct flights will further strengthen Pakistan-UK bilateral ties,” he said, adding that the journey of improvement in every national institution, through reforms, was progressing at a rapid pace. The EASA had barred PIA from operating in EU countries in June 2020 over safety concerns after a flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed near the Jinnah International Airport, killing around 100 passengers. The ban on flights followed the then aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan’s statement on the floor of parliament terming pilots’ licences “dubious”. EASA lifted the ban after more than four years on Nov 28 last year. In July 2025, the UK removed Pakistan from its Air Safety List, allowing Pakistani airlines to apply to operate flights in Britain. It should also be mentioned that the government is making efforts to sell the struggling national flag carrier, which has accumulated over $2.5 billion in losses in roughly a decade. In June, it received expressions of interest from five parties, including business groups and a military-owned firm.",

      "summary_orig": "Thailand’s former Queen Sirikit, the mother of the current King Vajiralongkorn and wife of the nation’s longest-reigning monarch, died late on Friday at the age of 93, the palace said. The royal family is venerated in Thailand, treated by many as semi-divine figures and lavished with glowing media coverage and gold-adorned portraits hanging in public spaces and private homes nationwide. Throughout her 66-year marriage to King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Sirikit carved a dual reputation as a fashionista and the nation’s caring matriarch — with some Western media featuring her on magazine covers and comparing her to former US first lady Jackie Kennedy. “I had heard that she had been unwell and, given that she was in her 90s, I knew this day would come,” 53-year-old housekeeper Sasis Putthasit said early on Saturday in the capital Bangkok. “But I didn’t expect it to be today,” Sasis told AFP . “I feel sad because she was a mother figure to the country, and now she’s gone.” Sirikit had “suffered several illnesses” while hospitalised since 2019, including a blood infection this month, the palace said in a statement. “Her majesty’s condition worsened until Friday and she passed away … at Chulalongkorn hospital at age 93,” it added. King Vajiralongkorn has assigned members of the royal family to begin a year-long mourning period, the palace said. From early on Saturday, Thai news anchors were seen wearing black during the morning broadcast, a sign of public mourning. Her passing “marks a profoundly significant event for the Thai Royal Family and the entire nation, given her immense popularity and deep connection to the late king who remains deeply revered”, Pavin Chachavalpongpun, a former Thai diplomat and academic who studies the monarchy, told AFP . Pakistan offers condolences Meanwhile, President Asif Ali Zardari expressed “deep sorrow” at the former queen’s passing and conveyed his condolences to King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened at Sirikit’s passing. “The people and government of Pakistan join me in extending our deepest condolences to His Majesty King Maha Vajiralongkorn, the royal family, and the people of Thailand. Our thoughts and prayers are with them at this time of national grief,” he said. ‘Mother of the Nation’ King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s remarkably lengthy reign from 1946 until 2016 was bookended by World War II and the first inauguration of US President Donald Trump. Though Bhumibol’s son inherited the throne about nine years ago, many still revere him as the nation’s most steadfast figurehead — and Sirikit as his constant companion. She retired from the public eye in recent years as she suffered from ailing health, her privacy sealed by strict lese majeste laws that limit what can be reported about the royal family. But in her glamorous heyday in the 1960s she mingled with US presidents and superstars such as Elvis Presley, while at home touring Thailand to visit villagers in rural areas. She was referred to as the “Mother of the Nation” and her birthday was designated the country’s Mothers’ Day. The reigning Chakri dynasty dates back to 1782 but the succession from King Vajiralongkorn is unclear as he has not formally named an heir. He has seven children including five sons — four from an earlier marriage who have been officially disowned, and his 20-year-old son Dipangkorn Rasmijoti. While the royal family is still held in very high regard by most Thais, it faced unprecedented public dissent during street protests in 2020. Tens of thousands of young protesters took to the streets demanding widespread political reforms including changes to the monarchy — a public challenge to the royals’ status never seen in Thailand before. Though Thailand’s constitution places the monarchy above politics, Sirikit drew public attention when she attended the funeral of a royalist protester in 2008. When her husband King Bhumibol died, Thailand observed a year-long mourning period. Authorities ordered flags to fly at half-mast for 30 days, banned weddings and concerts, and instructed citizens to wear black. Former Queen Sirikit’s body will lie in state at the Grand Palace’s Dusit Thorne Hall in the capital Bangkok, according to the palace.",

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA: Unknown armed men abducted 18 labourers at gunpoint and set fire to numerous vehicles in an attack on Thursday night at a construction company camp and its crushing plant in Naal area of Khuzdar district, officials said. The incident marks the second kidnapping of labourers in the region in four days. The first incident took place three days earlier, although it was only made public by the officials yesterday. Levies officials said over two dozen armed men stormed the camp and crushing plant of a private construction company late on Thursday in the Naal area, about 80 km from the district headquarters of Khuzdar. “They set at least eight vehicles and other machinery on fire and took away workers with them [to an] unknown destination,” a senior Levies force official in Naal said. Assailants also set ablaze many vehicles; incident comes days after gunmen abducted nine labourers in Mastung The company manager, Zulfiqar Ahmed, said the attackers initially took 20 people. “The armed men kidnapped 20 labourers from the camp but two of them were freed later on their way to an unknown destination,” Mr Ahmed said. He confirmed that the abducted workers belong to the Sindh. The labourers were working on a road project for the D. Baluch construction company, which is building roads to connect Naal with the areas of Washuk and Basima. Officials said that at least eight vehicles were completely gutted and other machinery was damaged in the attack. Security forces have launched a search operation in the area to find the kidnapped workers and the armed group responsible. In the previous attack, unidentified gunmen kidnapped nine labourers as they were returning home from their work on an under-construction building site. The assailants also hijacked the pickup truck in which the workers were travelling, all at gunpoint in the Dasht area of Mastung district. No one has claimed responsibility for either of the recent kidnapping incidents. Published in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",

      "summary_orig": "NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has backtracked from his proposed visit to Malaysia at the weekend to attend an Asean-related summit , joining the discussions “virtually” instead, it was officially announced on Friday. The opposition Congress party blamed the change of plan on Mr Modi’s fear of meeting President Donald Trump. The annual summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a 10-nation grouping, as well as associated meetings, will be held from Oct 26 to 28 in Kuala Lumpur. The Hindu said the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) had not provided any reason for Mr Modi’s decision, though the paper quoted Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as saying that Mr Modi had cited the “ongoing Deepavali celebrations” as the reason for the change in plans. The MEA announced that External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar will represent Mr Modi and lead the Indian delegation at the East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur on October 27. Asean is a key pillar of India’s Act East Policy and Asia-Pacific vision, the ministry said. Congress says Indian PM’s change of plans betrays his reluctance to meet Trump The Congress claimed that Mr Modi was attending the summit virtually instead of travelling to Malaysia to avoid “being cornered” by Mr Trump. Taking to social media platform X, Congress communication chief Jairam Ramesh said it was “one thing to post messages in praise of President Trump, but far too risky to be physically seen with the man who has claimed 53 times that he stopped Operation Sindoor and that India has promised to stop buying oil from Russia”. “The reason why Mr Modi is not going is simple. He just doesn’t want to be cornered by President Trump who will also be there. He refused an invitation to attend the Gaza peace summit in Egypt a few weeks back, precisely for this reason,” Mr Ramesh said. “It’s far too risky for him. The PM may well be recalling that old hit Bollywood number: “ Bachke rehna re baba, bachke rehna re ,” he added. In a separate post on X, Mr Ramesh reacted to a news report quoting a Reliance Industries spokesperson who said the company would recalibrate its import of Russian oil to align with the priorities of the Indian government. “Modi Proposes, Reliance Disp­oses, Trump Exposes,” he said. “Had a warm conversation with my dear friend, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim of Malaysia. Congratulated him on Malaysia’s Asean Chairmanship and conveyed best wishes for the success of upcoming summits. Look forward to joining the Asean-India Summit virtually, and to further deepening the Asean-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” said Mr Modi in a statement. In a statement posted on social media platform ‘X’, Mr Ibrahim said he discussed details of the 47th Asean summit with Mr Modi. “He [Prime Minister Modi] informed me that he will attend virtually due to the ongoing Deepavali celebrations in India at that time. I respect his decision and extended my greetings for a happy Deepavali to him and the entire people of India.” The East Asia Summit in Kuala Lumpur will draw a host of dignitaries, including President Trump. It was expected that the venue would provide a meeting opportunity for Mr Modi and Mr Trump, especially as the India-US relations remain uneasy after Mr Trump imposed punitive tariffs on India because of India’s purchase of Russian crude oil. The Hindu said Mr Trump and Mr Modi exchanged greetings on Deepavali on Tuesday as India-US negotiations for a trade pact continue. The two sides, however, gave differing takes on the conversation. It said President Trump was telling a group of prominent Indian-Americans and Indian Embassy officials in the White House that the telephone call focused on a trade deal, the purchase of Russian oil and “no war with Pakistan” and the Indian sources maintained that Pakistan was not discussed during the call. Officials had earlier given mixed signals about Mr Modi’s travel plans for Kuala Lumpur, saying that the Bihar election campaign required the PM’s attention. Earlier, President Trump had invited Mr Modi to the Sharm el-Sheikh peace summit for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but India was represented at the event by Kirti Vardhan Singh, Minister of State for External Affairs.

      "summary_orig": "QUETTA/ ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan-Afghanistan border continued to remain closed for all kinds of trade activities on Friday, due to persistent security concerns amid tensions with neighbouring Afghanistan. Officials denied reports that Islamabad had partially opened the border crossing at Chaman for Afghan transit trade. Even pedestrians are not allowed to cross the border from both sides, they added. “The border has been closed for the last 12 days and not opened for any commercial activities so far, including transit trade,” a senior customs official told Dawn. The official added that there were very few transit trade trucks parked at the Chaman crossing. The district administration officials also said that they have not yet received any instructions from the authorities from Islamabad about the opening of the border. The border opens for a very limited time for Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi, to return to their home country. Officials said only vehicles repatriating the household goods of Afghan refugees and returning to their country via the Chaman border were allowed to travel through the border. However, traders hope that the situation would be relaxed after a meeting between officials from Pakistan and Afghanistan in Istanbul today. ‘Customs staff ready’ Separately, the FBR announced that customs staffers are stationed at border points and ready to resume the clearance process as soon as it reopens and the situation returns to normal. The announcement from the tax department follows the build-up of over 1,000 trucks loaded with transit cargo, export consignments, and imported goods at the border stations with Afghanistan. The disruption stems from the suspension of customs clearance for both exports and imports at major border crossings — Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda — effective Oct 12, and at the Chaman border from Oct 15. An official announcement of the FBR said that bilateral trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan is temporarily halted due to security concerns at the border customs stations Before the suspension of bilateral trade took effect, customs officials successfully processed and cleared 363 import vehicles at Torkham, Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda crossings, falling under the jurisdiction of Northern region of Appraisement. At Torkham, clearance of 23 import vehicles remains pending due to the failure of importers to file goods declarations. The vehicles are carrying non-perishable items such as fabric, paint, peanuts, and pulses. Customs authorities are expected to process the consignments promptly once the required declarations are submitted by the respective importers or their clearing agents. With respect to exports, 255 vehicles remain parked inside the Torkham terminal due to the ongoing border closure, while around 200 more are stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road. Meanwhile, no import vehicles are pending clearance at the Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda border stations. Customs clearance operations at the Chaman Border Customs Station have remained suspended since Oct 15. As a result, five import vehicles and 23 export consignments are currently awaiting processing. Notably, the exporters have opted not to dray off their consignments, choosing instead to wait for the resumption of cross-border trade. In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added. Published in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",

At Torkham, clearance of 23 import vehicles remains pending due to the failure of importers to file goods declarations. The vehicles are carrying non-perishable items such as fabric, paint, peanuts, and pulses. Customs authorities are expected to process the consignments promptly once the required declarations are submitted by the respective importers or their clearing agents. With respect to exports, 255 vehicles remain parked inside the Torkham terminal due to the ongoing border closure, while around 200 more are stranded along the Jamrud–Landi Kotal road. Meanwhile, no import vehicles are pending clearance at the Ghulam Khan, Kharlachi, and Angoor Adda border stations. Customs clearance operations at the Chaman Border Customs Station have remained suspended since Oct 15. As a result, five import vehicles and 23 export consignments are currently awaiting processing. Notably, the exporters have opted not to dray off their consignments, choosing instead to wait for the resumption of cross-border trade. In terms of transit cargo, approximately 495 vehicles are queued for border crossing at Torkham and Chaman. Of these, the majority — 412 vehicles — are stranded at Chaman, while the remaining 83 are held up at Torkham, the announcement added. Published in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",

The Punjab governor noted that the alliance serves the country’s interests. “Pakistan is our top priority,” he added. Mr Khan conceded that party workers from both sides were finding it difficult to accept the alliance. “The PPP’s inclusion in the government was borne out of necessity, not choice, and it has come at a political cost for our party,” he said, warning that even a minor irresponsibility could derail the system. Mr Khan further said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had assured the PPP that its concerns would be addressed soon, even though PML-N leaders had admitted they could not meet several commitments. CM’s meeting with Imran The Punjab governor also said that KP Chief Minister Sohail Afridi should “definitely” be allowed to meet incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan. “There is democracy [in the country], and in my view, politicians should be dealt with in a political manner. The court has given [Mr Afridi] the permission to meet [Imran Khan], and if there is no legal hindrance, I see no reason why the meeting should not take place,” he said in response to a question. He also urged the KP government to have working relations with the federal government. “You need to hold talks to get your rights though a political process,” he added. View this post on Instagram He said the PPP owned the 26th Constitution Amend­ment and it was not rolled out of compulsion, noting that it would not have become possible without his party’s support. The Punjab governor said that his party had no knowledge about the 27th Consti­tution Amendment, adding that the PPP would only back it if is satisfied there was nothing wrong in it. ‘Role of bridge’ Speaking on the occasion, KP Governor Kundi said CM Afridi recently took oath and his cabinet was yet to be finalised as he was in Rawalpindi to meet his party’s founder. “I understand that every political party has its own age­nda but whenever it involves province, I have already suggested a parliamentary jirga should be formed to talk to the federal government,” he said, noting that issues could be discussed in Council of Common Interest meetings. He said that after merger of the tribal districts with KP, the province’s population had increased, adding that the PM had committed to hold meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) in August but it was delayed due to floods. “My doors are open. The Governor’s House will play role as a bridge between the provincial and federal government for peace and development of the province.” While talking about military operations in the province, Mr Kundi said the instable law and order situation in the merged districts was worsening with each passing day. “There is no other way except for intelligence-based operations.” He said representatives of the federal government visited Kabul and the Afghan interim government was asked not to allow India and Israel use its land against Pakistan. Mr Kundi noted that 80 per cent of the militant attacks in KP were being carried out in connivance with Afghanistan, adding that except for a facilitator, all the attackers on police training schools in Dera Ismail Khan were Afghan nationals.
